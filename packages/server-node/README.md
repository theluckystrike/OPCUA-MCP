# OPC UA MCP Server (Node)

A Node / TypeScript Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OPC UA operations, runnable with `npx`. It lets an MCP client read and write nodes, browse an address space, call methods, watch nodes for changes, and work the alarm and history surfaces of an OPC UA server.

There is a [Python runtime](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/tree/main/packages/server-python) exposing the same tools from the same contract. Both are first-class: one test suite runs against both, and they are released together under one version. Pick whichever stack you already run; the few declared differences between them, and the known divergences still being fixed, are listed in [docs/compatibility.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#runtime-differences).

## Features

- **Read nodes** — value, data type, status, timestamps, and the engineering unit and range the node publishes, so a `51.75` arrives labelled °C rather than bare
- **Write nodes** — with the value bounded by the node's own published `EURange` before anything is sent, on top of whatever your policy allows
- **Browse** — list children, walk a subtree, resolve a browse path or search by name, with each node's `HasTypeDefinition` so an alarm reads as an alarm rather than as `Object`
- **Call methods** on object nodes
- **Data-change subscriptions** — watch nodes instead of polling them, with an optional absolute or percent deadband so jitter is discarded at the server
- **Events and alarms** — collect events from a notifier node, list the alarms the server retains, and acknowledge, confirm, annotate or shelve them
- **History** — historical values, raw or summarised by a server-side aggregate, and events the server stored for a range that has already passed
- **Server health** — connection state, the namespace array, and the OPC UA server's own `ServerDiagnosticsSummary` counters
- **Tool profiles and an audit trail** — an observe-only default, an allowlist for control, and every control call recorded
- **Reconnection** — a dropped session is rebuilt with backoff and the subscriptions on it re-created

## Installation & Usage

### Using npx (Recommended)

You can run the server directly using npx without installing it globally:

```bash
npx opcua-mcp-server
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g opcua-mcp-server
opcua-mcp-server
```

### Registering with Claude Desktop or Codex

Rather than editing `claude_desktop_config.json` (or Codex's `config.toml`) by
hand, let the server write it:

```bash
opcua-mcp-server --install claude-desktop --dry-run \
  --url opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840 \
  --security-policy Basic256Sha256 \
  --client-cert /etc/opcua/client.pem --client-key /etc/opcua/client_key.pem \
  --server-cert /etc/opcua/server.pem
```

`--dry-run` validates the files and the combination with the server's own
startup parsers and prints a redacted preview and a security summary; drop it to
write (`--install codex` for Codex). It merges into the existing config, backs the
old one up, and records absolute paths — Claude Desktop is launched from the GUI
and does not inherit a login shell's `PATH`, so a bare `"command": "npx"` often
works in a terminal and fails in the app. The profile defaults to read-only; a
control profile must be chosen with `--profile`, and for a remote endpoint needs a
pinned `--server-cert`. Passwords are never accepted as flags. `--force` replaces
an existing `opcua` entry. Every flag and rule is in
[docs/install.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/install.md#3---install--let-the-server-write-the-config).

There is also a **downloadable `.mcpb` bundle** for Claude Desktop and
**single-file executables** that need no Node at all — see
[docs/install.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/install.md).

### Local Development

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd packages/server-node
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Tools

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: tool-reference from contract/tools.json by packages/server-node/scripts/config-artifacts.mjs. Do not edit by hand: edit the source, then run `npm run config:generate` in packages/server-node. -->

Both runtimes expose the same **15 tools** — 7 read, 4 monitor, 2 alarm-action and 2 control — defined once in [`contract/tools.json`](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/contract/tools.json).

| `list_active_alarms`      | read         | read-only, idempotent   | List the alarm and condition instances the server is currently retaining — those that are active, unacknowledged, or both.                                                                                                                            |

| `subscribe_events`        | monitor      | —                       | Start buffering OPC UA events (alarms, condition changes, plain events) from a notifier node.                                                                                                                                                         |

**Access** decides which `OPCUA_PROFILE` offers a tool. `read` and `monitor` tools are offered under every profile, including the default `observe`. `control` tools need `operator`, which offers them only for allowlisted targets, or `full`; `alarm-action` tools need `operator` with `OPCUA_ALLOW_ACKNOWLEDGE_ALARMS`, or `full`. Both also need a verified server — a secured channel and a pinned `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT` — unless a lab override is set: `OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL` for a channel with no security, `OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL` for an unpinned server. **Hints** are the MCP tool annotations each tool advertises.

† **Needs a server feature**: always listed, and refused at call time with `capability_not_supported` or `capability_unknown` when the connected server does not advertise what it needs — `read_opcua_history` on `AccessHistoryDataCapability` or `AggregateFunctions`; `read_event_history` on `AccessHistoryEventsCapability`.

<!-- END GENERATED: tool-reference -->

`read_opcua_history` needs
historical access (`AccessHistoryDataCapability`) or aggregates (a non-empty
`AggregateFunctions` folder), and its `aggregate_function` argument needs the
latter. `read_event_history` needs `AccessHistoryEventsCapability` — keeping
values and keeping events are different features and a server commonly does one
without the other. Every tool is listed whatever the plant is doing, with the
same schema, because MCP clients keep the first list they get and nothing tells
them reliably to ask again. A call the connected server cannot serve is refused
before anything is sent, with a code to act on — `capability_not_supported`,
`capability_unknown`, or `endpoint_offline` when the server cannot be reached —
and what to use instead. `get_server_status` → `capabilities` reports what the
server was found to offer, including its aggregate function names, on which
session and when.

**One tool per operation, not one per arity.** Reading one node and reading fifty
is the same request with a longer list, so it is one tool and one code path.

**Bounded, and honest about it.** Every request is bounded before it reaches the
OPC UA server — at most 500 nodes per read, 100 per write, 64 method arguments,
1 MiB of arguments, and fewer where the OPC UA server publishes lower
`OperationLimits`; the full list is in the
[tools reference](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/tools.md#how-much-one-call-may-ask-for).
A request over a bound is refused whole, never partly sent. And every result that
can be partial — history, events, browse, subscriptions — carries a
`completeness` object beside `result` in `structuredContent`: test
`completeness.complete`, and never infer it from how many records came back.

Full per-tool reference with inputs, outputs and a node-ID map:
**[docs/examples.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/examples.md)**.

## Resources

One resource, `opcua://subscriptions`: the active data-change subscriptions and the values each has buffered, as JSON. It is the same set of records `list_subscriptions` returns, re-readable without spending a tool call. See [Subscriptions](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/examples.md#data-change-subscriptions) for the shape and the worked example.

## Configuration

The server is configured entirely through environment variables. Every one is
declared, with its type, default and secrecy, in the repository's
[`contract/config.json`](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/contract/config.json),
which both runtimes are tested against and which ships inside this package:

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: config-reference from contract/config.json by packages/server-node/scripts/config-artifacts.mjs. Do not edit by hand: edit the source, then run `npm run config:generate` in packages/server-node. -->

29 settings in six groups. A blank value means the default, whatever the type; a boolean accepts `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` and `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`.

**Connection** — Which OPC UA server to talk to.

| Variable           | Default                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPCUA_SERVER_URL` | `opc.tcp://localhost:4840` | URL of the OPC UA server to connect to, including any path the server expects. Read once at startup: one process serves one endpoint. Nothing verifies who answers at this address unless the server certificate is pinned. |

**Channel security** — How the OPC UA secure channel is signed, encrypted and verified.

| Variable                | Default                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY` | `None`                                                       | Encryption suite to negotiate for the secure channel. Anything other than None needs a client certificate and key. The two AES suites are Node-only: the Python runtime refuses them at startup rather than downgrading. One of `None`, `Basic128Rsa15`, `Basic256`, `Basic256Sha256`, `Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`, `Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`. None is unencrypted and unauthenticated, and keeps control tools blocked unless insecure control is explicitly allowed. An unknown policy stops the server at startup.                                                                                           |
| `OPCUA_SECURITY_MODE`   | SignAndEncrypt once a security policy is set, otherwise None | Message security mode for the secure channel. Sign authenticates messages without encrypting them. One of `None`, `Sign`, `SignAndEncrypt`. A policy with mode None, or a mode without a policy, stops the server at startup; leaving it blank never downgrades a policy to signing only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT`     | —                                                            | Path to the certificate (PEM or DER) this client presents as its application identity. Required by any security policy other than None. A path that does not exist stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `OPCUA_CLIENT_KEY`      | —                                                            | Path to the private key matching the client certificate. A path, never key material. Whoever can read the file can impersonate this client: keep it readable only by the account running the server. A path that does not exist stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI` | the subjectAltName URI of the client certificate             | Application URI announced to the server. Set it only for a certificate that carries no URI of its own. A configured URI that conflicts with the certificate is refused before connecting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`     | —                                                            | Path to the OPC UA server's own certificate (PEM or DER), pinned: a server presenting any other certificate cannot complete the handshake. Control tools (writes, method calls, alarm actions) require it. Requires a security policy other than None. Unset, encryption protects against eavesdropping but not against an impostor endpoint, so control tools are refused unless OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL is set. Set without a security policy, it stops the server at startup rather than pinning nothing; a pinned certificate that has expired or is not yet valid refuses to connect. |

**User identity** — Who the OPC UA session logs in as.

| Variable          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OPCUA_USERNAME`  | —       | OPC UA username. The session is anonymous when unset. Cannot be combined with a user certificate. Requires a password; either one alone stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `OPCUA_PASSWORD`  | —       | **Secret.** Password for the username. Without a security policy it crosses the network in clear text. Supply it through the client's secret storage, never on a command line.                                                                                                                                           |
| `OPCUA_USER_CERT` | —       | Path to the certificate identifying the user, for X.509 user authentication: a different key pair from the client certificate, which secures the channel. Requires the user key and a security policy other than None; cannot be combined with a username. Any of those combinations broken stops the server at startup. |
| `OPCUA_USER_KEY`  | —       | Path to the private key for the user certificate. It signs the server's challenge and is never sent. Whoever can read the file can log in as this user: keep it readable only by the account running the server.                                                                                                         |

**Tool policy** — Which MCP tools are offered, and what a control tool may touch.

| Variable                                | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPCUA_PROFILE`                         | `observe` | Which tools are offered. observe reads, browses, reads history and monitors; operator adds explicitly allowlisted writes, method calls and alarm actions; full exposes every tool and is meant only for a tightly scoped OPC UA account. One of `observe`, `operator`, `full` (`read-only` means `observe`; `readonly` means `observe`). Unset fails closed to observe; an unknown profile stops the server at startup.                                                                                         |
| `OPCUA_POLICY_FILE`                     | —         | Path to a version-1 JSON policy file, the only place per-node value bounds can be set. Every policy variable that is set overrides what the file says. An unreadable or invalid file stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `OPCUA_ALLOWED_TOOLS`                   | —         | Comma-separated tool allowlist. It can only narrow the selected profile, never widen it. An unknown tool name stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `OPCUA_ALLOWED_WRITE_NODES`             | —         | Comma-separated exact node IDs the operator profile may write, as ns=2;i=5 or, stable across a server restart, nsu=&lt;namespace-uri>;i=5. Setting it replaces the policy file's list, bounds included. Empty fails closed: operator can write nothing. A batch write with any target outside the list is refused before it reaches OPC UA.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `OPCUA_ALLOWED_METHODS`                 | —         | Comma-separated object_node_id\|method_node_id pairs the operator profile may call. Empty fails closed: operator can call nothing. An entry without \| stops the server at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `OPCUA_ALLOW_ACKNOWLEDGE_ALARMS`        | `false`   | Let the operator profile act on alarms: acknowledge_alarm and every act_on_alarm action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL`          | `false`   | Permit control tools on an OPC UA channel with no security policy (None). Does not cover a secured channel to an unverified server; that is OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL. Fail-open override: writes, method calls and alarm actions then travel unauthenticated and unencrypted. Reported as control=INSECURE-OVERRIDE in the startup line, get_server_status and every audit record. Never enable it against production equipment.                                                                   |
| `OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL` | `false`   | Permit control tools on a secured OPC UA channel whose server certificate is not pinned with OPCUA_SERVER_CERT. Does not cover a channel with no security policy; that is OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL. Fail-open override: writes, method calls and alarm actions are then encrypted to whichever server answered the endpoint, which may be an impostor. Reported as control=UNVERIFIED-OVERRIDE in the startup line, get_server_status and every audit record. Never enable it against production equipment. |
| `OPCUA_ALLOW_OUT_OF_RANGE_WRITES`       | `false`   | Allow a write outside the EURange the OPC UA server itself published for the node. Fail-open override: it discards the only value bound a deployment with no policy file has.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Audit** — Where the control audit trail goes, and what it is labelled with.

| Variable                     | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPCUA_AUDIT_FILE`           | —        | Path to an append-only file for the control audit trail, one JSON object per line, written beside stderr. Created owner-only (0600) if it does not exist; reopened when rotated away. A file that cannot be opened, or that is a symlink, not a regular file, another account's, or group/world-writable, stops the server rather than falling back to stderr alone. While set, a control call whose record cannot be written is refused (fail closed); reads continue. |
| `OPCUA_AUDIT_FSYNC`          | `always` | When an audit-file record counts as written. always fsyncs each record before the control call proceeds, so it survives a power loss; none leaves it to the operating system, so it survives only a crash of this process. One of `always`, `none`. none can lose the records of control calls that already reached the plant if the machine loses power.                                                                                                               |
| `OPCUA_AUDIT_CHAIN`          | `none`   | Adds seq, prev_hash and hash to every audit record so edits, deletions and reordering can be detected with --verify-audit. sha256 catches accidental or naive edits; hmac-sha256 also resists anyone without the key. Requires the audit file. One of `none`, `sha256`, `hmac-sha256`. Set without an audit file, or hmac-sha256 without a key file, stops the server. No chain detects a truncated tail.                                                               |
| `OPCUA_AUDIT_CHAIN_KEY_FILE` | —        | Path to the HMAC key for the hmac-sha256 audit chain: at least 32 bytes, for example from openssl rand -hex 32. Surrounding whitespace is ignored. Whoever can read the key can forge the chain: a key readable or writable by group or others stops the server. Refused unless the chain is hmac-sha256.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `OPCUA_OPERATOR_ID`          | —        | Label stamped on every audit record as operator_label, so a shipped log says which deployment a control call came from. Configured, never verified: it is not an identity, and mcp_principal stays null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Reconnection** — How a refused or dropped connection is retried.

| Variable                           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OPCUA_RECONNECT_INITIAL_DELAY_MS` | `1000`  | Wait before the first attempt to repair a dropped or refused connection, in milliseconds. It doubles with each further attempt.                                                                                                |

Names are case-insensitive, and a policy on its own implies `SignAndEncrypt`.
An unusable combination — a mode without a policy, a policy without a
certificate, a username without a password — is refused at startup with a
message naming the variable. With no security configured the connection is
unencrypted and unauthenticated, and the server says so on stderr; see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
Making a client certificate and getting it trusted:
[docs/certificates.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/certificates.md).

Examples:

```bash
# unsecured, e.g. against the bundled mock
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840 npx opcua-mcp-server

# encrypted and authenticated
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://plc.example.internal:4840 \
OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY=Basic256Sha256 \
OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT=/etc/opcua/client.pem \
OPCUA_CLIENT_KEY=/etc/opcua/client_key.pem \
OPCUA_SERVER_CERT=/etc/opcua/plc_server.pem \
OPCUA_USERNAME=mcp-operator OPCUA_PASSWORD=… \
  npx opcua-mcp-server
```

### Deciding what the agent may do

Three profiles, and the default is the restrictive one:

| `OPCUA_PROFILE`       | What it offers                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `observe` _(default)_ | Read, browse, history and monitoring. No writes, no methods          |
| `operator`            | The above, plus **only** the write targets and methods you allowlist |
| `full`                | Every tool                                                           |

`operator` is the one worth understanding. A write to a node outside
`OPCUA_ALLOWED_WRITE_NODES` is refused before anything reaches OPC UA, and one
forbidden target rejects an entire batch rather than letting part of it through.
Both `operator` and `full` also require a **verified server**: a security
policy _and_ the server's certificate pinned with `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`. Encrypted
is not enough — without the pin the channel is encrypted to whoever answered.
Two lab-only overrides say otherwise in as many words, one per missing property:
`OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL=true` for a channel with no security, and
`OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL=true` for a secured one to an unpinned
server. A refused control call names the variable to set, and
`get_server_status` → `server_identity` says which of the three is in force.

The policy is enforced again on **every call**, not only when tools are listed —
an MCP client may hold a stale catalogue, and a hidden tool is a usability
feature rather than a security boundary.

A `writable_nodes` entry in a policy file may also bound the **value**, not only
the node: `min`, `max`, `enum` and `max_change` narrow what an allowlisted node
will accept, so a model that picks the right node and hallucinates `9999`
instead of `99.9` is refused. The node's own published `EURange` applies on top,
which is the only value bound that exists with no policy file at all. See
[Bounding the value, not only the node](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#bounding-the-value-not-only-the-node).

Every control call is recorded — its targets, its outcome, the endpoint it went
to, the session it rode on and the attempt number — to stderr and, with
`OPCUA_AUDIT_FILE` set, to an owner-only, append-only JSON-lines file beside it,
fsync'd per record. A control call whose record cannot be written is refused
rather than sent; reads carry on. `OPCUA_AUDIT_CHAIN` adds an optional hash
chain, checked with `opcua-mcp-server --verify-audit FILE… [--key-file KEY]`.
What the file can and cannot prove is in
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/SECURITY.md#what-the-local-audit-file-can-and-cannot-prove).

### Staying connected

The connection is re-established by itself: a dropped or refused session is
retried with exponential backoff, and the read and write paths rebuild a dead
session rather than failing until the process is restarted. Data-change
subscriptions are re-created on the new session — the IDs keep working and the
values already buffered are still there to be read. Event
subscriptions are re-created too, and the next `read_events` notes that events
raised while the connection was down were not received. Tune it with
`OPCUA_RECONNECT_INITIAL_DELAY_MS`, `OPCUA_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY_MS`,
`OPCUA_RECONNECT_MAX_RETRY` and `OPCUA_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` above.

The MCP server starts whether or not the OPC UA server is reachable: it answers
`initialize` at once and makes its first connection in the background, so an
endpoint that is down — even with `OPCUA_RECONNECT_MAX_RETRY=-1` — is reported
rather than leaving the MCP client waiting on a server that never starts.

`get_server_status` reports whether the connection is up and what the OPC UA
server says about itself; it is the one tool that answers while the connection is
down, and calling it is also what brings a dropped one back. See
[Staying connected](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#staying-connected).

A control call whose session died before its response arrived is **not** silently
re-sent. OPC UA lets a Write partially succeed and defines no operation order, so
a dead session never proves the write did not land: the server rebuilds the
connection and then says plainly that the request may or may not have reached the
plant, naming what it was aimed at.

## Integration with Cursor/Claude

This server can be integrated with Cursor IDE or Claude Desktop for OPC UA operations. Add the following to your MCP configuration:

### Cursor Configuration

Add to your Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opcua-node": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["opcua-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPCUA_SERVER_URL": "opc.tcp://localhost:4840"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opcua-node": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["opcua-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPCUA_SERVER_URL": "opc.tcp://localhost:4840"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage in Conversation

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform real-world OPC UA operations:

### Reading Sensor Values

- "What is the current temperature reading from the reactor vessel?"
- "Check the pressure level in Tank A"
- "Read all temperature sensors in the cooling system"
- "Get the current flow rate on production line B"

### Controlling Equipment

- "Turn on the conveyor motor"
- "Set the mixer speed to 80 RPM"
- "Open valve V-101 to 75% position"
- "Start the circulation pump"
- "Set the heating element to 150°C"

### Alarms

- "What alarms are active right now?"
- "Acknowledge the high-temperature alarm with a note about the cause"
- "Shelve that chattering level alarm for thirty minutes"
- "What fired overnight on the packaging line?"

### System Monitoring

- "Read all sensor values from the water treatment plant"
- "Check the status of all pumps and motors"
- "Is the plant server refusing our connections, or just slow?"
- "Watch the reactor temperature and ignore changes under 0.5°C"
- "Show me a complete inventory of all sensors and actuators"

### Real Example Scenarios

```
User: "What's the temperature in reactor R-101?"
Assistant: I'll read the temperature sensor for reactor R-101.
Tool call: read_opcua_nodes with node_ids ["ns=2;i=11"]
Result: "Reactor R-101 temperature: 87.3 °C (range 0–150 °C)"

User: "Turn on the main conveyor motor"
Assistant: I'll start the main conveyor motor for you.
Tool call: write_opcua_nodes with nodes [{node_id: "ns=2;i=12", value: true}]
Result: "Main conveyor motor started successfully"

User: "Set the pump speed to 65%"
Assistant: I'll adjust the pump speed to 65%.
Tool call: write_opcua_nodes with nodes [{node_id: "ns=2;i=13", value: 65}]
Result: "Pump speed set to 65%"

User: "Show me all available variables in the system"
Assistant: I'll browse the OPC UA server's address space.
Tool call: browse_opcua_nodes
Result: "Found 15 variables:
- Name: Temperature_Sensor_01, NodeID: ns=2;i=101, Type: AnalogItemType, Value: 87.3 °C
- Name: Pressure_Sensor_01, NodeID: ns=2;i=102, Type: AnalogItemType, Value: 2.5 bar
- Name: Flow_Rate_01, NodeID: ns=2;i=103, Type: AnalogItemType, Value: 125.8 L/min
..."
```

## Security Considerations

- The connection defaults to no security (`SecurityPolicy.None`); set
  `OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY` and credentials as shown under
  [Configuration](#configuration) for anything beyond local development
- The tool profile defaults to **observe-only**. Writes and methods require
  `OPCUA_PROFILE=operator` _and_ an explicit allowlist (or `OPCUA_PROFILE=full`,
  which needs none), over a channel to a verified server
- Pin the endpoint with `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`. Without it the server certificate is
  taken from the endpoint description and not checked against anything, so
  encryption protects against eavesdropping but not against an impostor endpoint
  — and control tools are refused unless `OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL`
  says otherwise, for a lab
- Ensure proper network security when connecting to industrial OPC UA servers
- Scope the OPC UA account you connect with to what the assistant should be able
  to do — the MCP policy is defense in depth, not a replacement for OPC UA
  authorization

See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
for the full posture and what the servers do and do not verify.

## Error Handling

The server provides detailed error messages for:

- Connection failures, distinguishing a refusal from an outage mid-request
- Invalid node IDs, and arguments a schema rejects — including misspelled
  optional ones, which are refused rather than silently ignored
- Type conversion errors
- Values outside a node's published range or a policy's bounds
- Method call failures
- Read/write operation errors

## Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP SDK for Node.js
- `node-opcua-client`: OPC UA client library for Node.js (the client half of `node-opcua`; the server half is not needed here and is deliberately not a dependency)
- `ajv`: JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) validation of tool arguments against the contract
- `node-opcua-crypto`: reads the configured certificates and private keys (application URI, validity dates)
