# OPC UA MCP — Test Suite

Three tiers, fastest first. Pick the narrowest one that covers your change.

| Tier | Directory | Needs | Time | What it is for |
|------|-----------|-------|------|----------------|
| **unit** | `unit/` | nothing (a built Node server for the `--install` parity tests) | ~5s | Pure logic: ISO-8601 parsing, contract invariants, version manifests, security config, `--install` |
| **e2e** | `e2e/` | mock OPC UA servers + built Node server | ~70s | Drives both real servers over stdio via the `mcp` client SDK, unsecured and secured |
| **smoke** | `smoke/` | npm + uv (+ PyInstaller for the executables) | ~60s | Builds every downloadable artifact — npm tarball, wheel, `.mcpb` bundle, single-file executables — and drives them |

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest unit/         # fast inner loop
uv run --no-sync pytest               # unit + e2e (smoke is deselected by default)
uv run --no-sync pytest -m smoke smoke/
```

The Node server has its own unit tests, run separately:

```bash
cd packages/server-node && npm run build && npm test
```

**Why the smoke tier exists:** everything else runs from the source tree, where
relative paths happen to resolve and dependencies come from `uv.lock`. Users get
a tarball, a wheel, a bundle or a binary. That gap has shipped real bugs — a wheel
that raised `FileNotFoundError` on import, and an unbounded `mcp` dependency that
resolved to a breaking major on any fresh install. Both were invisible to the e2e
suite.

The gap is widest for the two newest artifacts, which is why they are built here
rather than trusted:

| Artifact | What only this tier can catch |
|---|---|
| `.mcpb` bundle (`test_artifacts.py`) | The whole dependency tree is bundled into one file with the contract inlined, so there is no `node_modules` and no `contract.json` on disk. node-opcua needs `require`, `__filename` and `__dirname` supplied by hand to survive that. |
| Executables (`test_binaries.py`) | An embedded interpreter, no packaging metadata in the usual place, and a `--install` that must name the binary alone — handing a frozen app `-m opcua_mcp_server` writes a config entry that fails every launch. |

The executables cannot be cross-compiled, so this tier only ever covers the
platform it runs on. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and checks the other
two.

To test files that already exist instead of building fresh ones, point
`OPCUA_SMOKE_ARTIFACTS_DIR` at a directory holding them (the `.tgz`, `.whl` +
`.tar.gz`, `.mcpb`, and this platform's `opcua-mcp-server-{node,python}-*`).
`release.yml` does this with the exact files it is about to attach — after the
macOS and Windows executables are signed, since signing rewrites them — so what
is driven over MCP is what ships. A missing or ambiguous file is a failure, not
a skip.

PyInstaller comes from an opt-in dependency group:
`uv sync --all-packages --group packaging`.

## What the e2e tier covers

Every test runs against **both** server implementations.

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `test_lists_core_tools` | The 12 core tools in `CORE_TOOLS` are advertised |
| `test_history_tool_exposed_when_supported` | `read_opcua_history` is advertised by both runtimes |
| `test_the_aggregate_argument_is_offered_even_where_unsupported` | `aggregate_function` is listed against a mock with no aggregates — the catalogue does not depend on the server (#140) |
| `test_an_aggregate_call_against_a_server_without_them_errors_cleanly` | …and calling it is refused with `capability_not_supported` and a remediation |
| `test_aggregate_tool_exposed_when_supported` | Against the aggregate-capable mock, `get_server_status` reports the functions it offers |
| `test_aggregate_average_values_are_correct` | `Average` over a known ramp advances by exactly one interval per bucket |
| `test_aggregate_default_end_time_is_utc` | Omitting `end_time` does not overshoot the window on a non-UTC host (#24) |
| `test_aggregate_rejects_unknown_function` | An unsupported aggregate name is rejected, listing what the server offers |
| `test_read_single_node` | `read_opcua_nodes` with one node id returns a value |
| `test_read_multiple_nodes` | `read_opcua_nodes` returns all requested nodes |
| `test_browse_discovers_variables_below_a_root` | `browse_opcua_nodes` with `depth` and `node_class: "Variable"` discovers the address space |
| `test_browse_children` | `browse_opcua_nodes` lists the four folders |
| `test_write_numeric_node` | Writing a `Double` actuator succeeds |
| `test_write_boolean_node` | Writing a `Boolean` node with `"true"` succeeds (bool-handling regression) |
| `test_call_method_start_then_stop` | `call_opcua_method` drives `StartProduction`/`StopProduction` and `SystemMode` reacts |
| `test_read_history` | The history tool (`read_opcua_history`) returns timestamped records |
| `test_event_tools_are_always_advertised` | The four event tools are not capability-gated |
| `test_subscribe_then_read_receives_an_event` | `subscribe_events` + `read_events` deliver an event the mock raised, in the canonical record shape |
| `test_reading_twice_drains_the_buffer` | An event is handed over once, never twice |
| `test_severity_floor_drops_quieter_events` | `severity_min` keeps the alarm (700) and drops its clearing (100) |
| `test_reading_without_subscribing_says_so` | Both runtimes word that mistake identically |
| `test_a_server_without_conditions_says_so` | A server with no Alarms & Conditions gets a legible error, not an empty list |
| `test_lists_and_acknowledges_a_real_alarm` | Against the alarms mock: list a retained, unacknowledged condition and acknowledge it by `event_id` |
| `test_an_unknown_event_id_cannot_be_acknowledged` | An `event_id` the server never reported has no condition to act on |
| `test_condition_events_reach_the_buffer_too` | A condition is an event: `read_events` sees it, with its condition fields filled in |
| `test_an_overflowing_buffer_tells_the_caller_what_it_lost` | A dropped event is reported in the response, not only on stderr |
| `test_a_refresh_that_never_finishes_is_an_error` | A ConditionRefresh that times out fails rather than returning a partial list |
| `test_refuses_to_start_without_the_certificate_the_policy_needs` | A security policy with no certificate exits with the same `Configuration error: …` on both runtimes |
| `test_reads_and_writes_over_a_secured_connection` | Read/write work over Basic256Sha256, in `Sign` and in `SignAndEncrypt` |
| `test_the_password_never_reaches_the_logs` | `OPCUA_PASSWORD` appears nowhere in the server's stderr |
| `test_default_mode_is_sign_and_encrypt` | A policy with no explicit mode negotiates the strongest endpoint, not the weakest |
| `test_the_application_uri_comes_from_the_certificate` | With no `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI`, both runtimes announce the certificate's own `subjectAltName` URI |
| `test_a_wrong_password_is_rejected` | Bad credentials yield `BadUserAccessDenied`, never a working session |
| `test_an_unsecured_client_cannot_use_the_secured_server` | With no security configured there is no endpoint to fall back to, and the server warns |
| `test_reports_a_live_connection` | `get_server_status` reports the endpoint and security actually in force |
| `test_reports_the_servers_own_status` | State, clock and start time come from the OPC UA server — `current_time` falls inside the call window |
| `test_reports_the_servers_build_info` | The mock identifies itself (`FreeOpcUa`), so the read is a real one |
| `test_reports_the_namespace_array` | Namespace index → URI, indexes 0..n, the OPC UA namespace first |
| `test_both_servers_report_the_same_thing` | One report, two runtimes: everything but the moving timestamps is identical |
| `test_answers_when_the_server_is_unreachable` | Pointed at a dead port, the status tool reports `connected: false` and why, rather than failing |
| `test_other_tools_say_what_to_call_when_disconnected` | Both runtimes point at `get_server_status`, in the same words |
| `test_reads_recover_after_the_server_restarts` | The OPC UA server is stopped and restarted on the same endpoint; reads work again with no MCP restart |
| `test_writes_recover_after_the_server_restarts` | The write path re-establishes a dead session too, and the value lands |
| `test_status_reports_the_reconnection` | The server's *start time* has moved afterwards — proof of a new session, not a believed-in old one |
| `test_subscriptions_are_re_established_after_a_restart` | A subscription ID survives the outage and delivers again; its buffered changes survive with it |
| `test_a_bad_retry_setting_is_rejected_at_startup` | An unparseable `OPCUA_RECONNECT_*` value stops both runtimes rather than silently defaulting |
| `test_an_unsecured_session_reports_no_unexpected_deprecation` / `test_an_x509_user_session_reports_no_unexpected_deprecation` | Neither server prints a deprecation that is not on `fixtures/deprecation-allowlist.json` while connecting, reading, browsing, writing, or authenticating with an X.509 user certificate (#150) |

Both servers expose the history tool under the same name, `read_opcua_history`,
whatever the server advertises; a call the server cannot serve is refused with
`capability_not_supported`.

## Mock servers

Five are used, on purpose. Each is started by its fixture on a **fresh
ephemeral port**, so two checkouts can run the suite at once without
colliding (#46):

| Mock | Role |
|------|------|
| `packages/mock-server` (python-opcua) | Industrial address space, history, methods. Advertises **no** aggregate functions — this is what makes the capability-gating assertions meaningful. |
| `packages/mock-server-aggregate` (node-opcua) | Advertises aggregate functions and genuinely implements `ReadProcessedDetails`. Ramps `Temperature` (`ns=1;i=1001`) by +1.0/second so aggregates are verifiable arithmetically. |
| `packages/mock-server-alarms` (node-opcua) | Has a real `ExclusiveLimitAlarm` on a writable `Temperature` (`ns=1;i=1001`), so ConditionRefresh and Acknowledge are exercised against a genuine condition instance. Starts with the alarm active, and a test re-arms it by writing below then above the limit. |
| `restartable_opcua_server` (fixture, python-opcua) | A fifth instance of the main mock, function-scoped and unshared, that a test may stop and start again on the same endpoint. The resilience tests need to take a server away; doing that to the session-wide mock would break every other test using it. |
| `tests/fixtures/secure_opcua_server.py` (python-opcua) | Offers **only** Basic256Sha256 endpoints and requires a username — the unsecured mocks cannot tell a working security config from an ignored one. Certificates are generated per session into a temp dir (`secure_pki`), never committed. `--check-client-uri` adds the ApplicationUri-against-certificate check that real servers make and python-opcua's does not. |

The main mock cannot serve aggregates even in principle: python-opcua answers
`ReadProcessedDetails` with `BadNotImplemented`. It cannot serve conditions
either — python-opcua has no condition model, so there is no ConditionRefresh to
call and no Acknowledge method to invoke. It *does* raise plain events (it
announces every change of its alarm state), which is what the
`subscribe_events` / `read_events` tests need, and its lack of conditions is
what makes the "a server without A&C says so" assertion meaningful.

The secured mock accepts any client certificate, because python-opcua's server
has no trust list. Real equipment does: a Siemens, Kepware or Prosys server
rejects an unknown client certificate until an operator moves it into its trusted
folder. That step, and vendor-specific certificate handling generally, can only
be verified by hand against the real server.

## Prerequisites

- `uv`, `node` (>=22.13, matching the server's `engines.node`), `npm`
- Set up the workspace once (from the repo root): `uv sync --all-packages`
- Build the Node server once: `cd packages/server-node && npm install && npm run build`
  (Node tests are **skipped** if `build/index.js` is missing).
- Install the aggregate mock once: `cd packages/mock-server-aggregate && npm install`
  (aggregate tests are **skipped** if its `node_modules` is missing, or on Node <20 —
  `node-opcua-aggregates` pulls dependencies that require it. This limits the test
  fixture only; the shipped Node server needs Node 22.13+).
- Install the alarms mock once: `cd packages/mock-server-alarms && npm install`
  (the Alarms & Conditions tests are **skipped** on the same terms).

## Running

```bash
cd tests
uv run --no-sync pytest -v
```

`pytest` runs the unit and e2e tiers; smoke is deselected by default via
`addopts = "-ra -m 'not smoke'"` because it builds and installs packages.

The suite starts its own mock OPC UA servers, each on a free port picked for the
session, and waits a few seconds for history to accumulate. To point it at a
server you manage yourself instead — one left running while iterating, or a real
device — set the endpoint explicitly; nothing is started, and arranging enough
history for the tests that read it back is then yours:

```bash
OPCUA_SERVER_URL="opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/" uv run --no-sync pytest -v
OPCUA_AGGREGATE_SERVER_URL="opc.tcp://localhost:4841/UA/Aggregate" uv run --no-sync pytest -v
OPCUA_ALARM_SERVER_URL="opc.tcp://localhost:4842/UA/Alarms" uv run --no-sync pytest -v
```

A standalone mock defaults to `:4840` (`uv run opcua-mock-server`, overridable
with `--endpoint`); the aggregate mock defaults to `:4841` (`npm start` in
`packages/mock-server-aggregate`, overridable with `AGGREGATE_MOCK_PORT`); the
alarms mock defaults to `:4842` (`npm start` in `packages/mock-server-alarms`,
overridable with `ALARM_MOCK_PORT`).

### Required mode

A skipped fixture is convenient locally and dangerous in a gate: `publish.yml`
once installed only one of the two Node-based mocks, so every Alarms &
Conditions test skipped on every release while the job stayed green (#142).

```bash
OPCUA_TESTS_REQUIRED=1 uv run --no-sync pytest -v e2e/ unit/
```

With it set, [`required_suite.py`](required_suite.py):

- reports **any skip as a failure**, unless its reason is listed in
  `ALLOWED_SKIPS` with a justification (the list is empty today);
- fails the run if a **test group executed no passing tests** — unit, core,
  each runtime, security, history, aggregates, events, alarms, resilience,
  differential parity, and each executable. A group is enforced only when its
  part of the suite (`unit/`, `e2e/`, `smoke/test_binaries.py`) was selected,
  so running only the smoke tier does not demand the alarms mock.

Every run, required or not, ends with a per-group summary of what executed.
CI's E2E and smoke jobs, `publish.yml` and `release.yml` all set it; the E2E
steps they share live in [`.github/actions/conformance`](../.github/actions/conformance/action.yml).

Select a single implementation:

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k "[python]"
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k "[node]"
```

The brackets matter: they match the parametrisation id. A plain `-k node` would
also match test *names* like `test_read_single_node`.

## Real-server conformance (opt-in)

`conformance/` is not a pytest tier: it drives both runtimes against an OPC UA
server *you* point it at, described by a JSON config, and writes a result file
rather than passing or failing. It is how `docs/compatibility.md`'s server matrix
is produced — see [Real-server conformance](../docs/compatibility.md#real-server-conformance)
for the config format and what the outcomes mean.

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -m conformance run --config ../compatibility/labs/milo.json
uv run --no-sync python -m conformance render
```

What the unit tier does check, in `unit/test_conformance.py`: that a config
cannot hold a credential, that a result cannot hold an endpoint, node id or
secret, and that the committed matrix is exactly what the committed results say.

## Notes

- Deprecation warnings are errors. In this process, `deprecations.py` (loaded
  from `conftest.py`) turns every `DeprecationWarning` into a failure except the
  upstream ones listed in `fixtures/deprecation-allowlist.json`; each entry there
  names an issue, an owner and when it can go. See
  [docs/dependency-policy.md](../docs/dependency-policy.md#deprecations).
- The mock server's method callbacks update internal state; OPC UA node values
  are propagated by its 1 Hz simulation loop, so tests poll (see
  `wait_for_node_value`) rather than reading immediately after a method call.
- Writes to sensor/actuator nodes may be overwritten within ~1s by the
  simulation loop; only the command variables (`StartProductionCommand`, …) and
  methods persist.
- The event tests drive the main mock's alarm state through those command
  variables (emergency stop, then reset) and reset it again on the way out: the
  whole session shares one mock, and a test that leaves the plant latched in
  MAINTENANCE hands the next one a different machine.
