# Testing the OPC UA MCP Servers

Three ways to test, from fully automated to fully interactive:

1. [Automated end-to-end suite](#1-automated-end-to-end-suite) (`pytest`)
2. [MCP Inspector](#2-mcp-inspector) — point-and-click or one-line CLI
3. [AI agents](#3-ai-agents) — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor

Plus [a secured connection by hand](#4-a-secured-connection-by-hand), for when
you are turning encryption and credentials on.

> **All three need the mock OPC UA server running first** — it is the simulated
> device the MCP servers talk to.
>
> ```bash
> uv sync --all-packages            # one-time, from the repo root
> uv run --no-sync opcua-mock-server
> # opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/  (history enabled on all variables)
> ```
>
> Build the Node server once: `cd packages/server-node && npm install && npm run build`.

A handy node-ID reference and per-tool examples live in [examples.md](examples.md).
Common nodes: Temperature `ns=2;i=3`, PumpEnabled `ns=2;i=12`, ValvePosition
`ns=2;i=13`, SystemMode `ns=2;i=19`, Methods folder `ns=2;i=27`, StartProduction
`ns=2;i=28`.

## 1. Automated end-to-end suite

Drives **both** servers over stdio with the official `mcp` client SDK and asserts
on real responses, against an unsecured mock and a secured one. Each mock is
started by its fixture on a free ephemeral port, so several checkouts can run the
suite at the same time.

```bash
uv sync --all-packages         # one-time, from the repo root
cd tests
uv run --no-sync pytest -v
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k python     # only the Python server
uv run --no-sync pytest -v -k "[node]"   # only the Node server
```

The suite starts its own mocks. To point it at a server you manage instead, set
`OPCUA_SERVER_URL` (or `OPCUA_AGGREGATE_SERVER_URL` / `OPCUA_ALARM_SERVER_URL`).
See [../tests/README.md](../tests/README.md) for the full matrix.

The aggregate and Alarms & Conditions tests need their mocks installed once, and
skip cleanly until they are:

```bash
(cd packages/mock-server-aggregate && npm install)
(cd packages/mock-server-alarms && npm install)
```

Skipping is for a laptop. CI and the release workflows run the suite with
`OPCUA_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`, which reports any skip as a failure and fails the run
if a test group — alarms, aggregates, security, either runtime, and so on —
executed nothing. Set it locally to check a run is complete; see
[../tests/README.md](../tests/README.md#required-mode).

## 2. MCP Inspector

[`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
is the standard tool for exercising an MCP server by hand.

### UI mode (interactive)

```bash
# Node server
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ OPCUA_PROFILE=full OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL=true \
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node packages/server-node/build/index.js

# Python server
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ OPCUA_PROFILE=full OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL=true \
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory packages/server-python run opcua-mcp-server
```

It prints a `http://localhost:6274/?...` URL. In the browser:

1. Click **Connect** (status should turn green).
2. Open the **Tools** tab → **List Tools**.
   - **`read_opcua_history`** is always listed. Against a server without
     history, a call is refused with `capability_not_supported`.
3. Select a tool, fill the form, click **Run Tool**, read the result pane.

Things to try:

| Tool | Arguments | Expected |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `read_opcua_nodes` | `node_ids` = `["ns=2;i=3"]` | one record, `"node_id": "ns=2;i=3"`, `"value": 25.x`, `"status": "Good"` |
| `browse_opcua_nodes` | *(none)* | one record: `nodes` = the Objects folder's children (`2:IndustrialControlSystem`), `truncated`, `inspected` |
| `read_opcua_history` | `node_id` = `ns=2;i=3`, `num_values` = `5` | 5 records of `{ value, timestamp, status }`, status `Good`, ISO-8601 UTC timestamps — identical on both servers |
| `read_opcua_history` | `node_id` = `ns=2;i=3`, `start_time` = `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z` | records within the window |
| `read_opcua_history` | `node_id` = `ns=2;i=3`, `start_time` = `nope` | clear error: *Use ISO 8601…* |
| `write_opcua_nodes` | `nodes` = `[{"node_id": "ns=2;i=13", "value": 80}]` | one record, `"node_id": "ns=2;i=13"`, `"status": "Good"`, `"error": null` |
| `call_opcua_method` | `object_node_id` = `ns=2;i=27`, `method_node_id` = `ns=2;i=28`, `arguments` = `["60"]` | `"outputs": [true]`, `"status": "Good"` (SystemMode → AUTO within ~1s) |
| `subscribe_opcua_nodes` | `node_ids` = `["ns=2;i=3"]`, `publishing_interval` = `500` | one record, `change_count` 0 or 1 |
| `list_subscriptions` | *(none)* | a few seconds later, the same record with `change_count` climbing and `changes` filling |
| `unsubscribe_opcua_nodes` | `subscription_ids` = `["sub-1"]` | the removed record, `"subscription_id": "sub-1"`, with its `change_count` and `changes` |
| `subscribe_events` | *(none)* | one record, `"node_id": "ns=0;i=2253"`, `"buffer_size": 100`, `"severity_min": 0`, `"replaced": false` |
| `write_opcua_nodes` | `nodes` = `[{"node_id": "ns=2;i=25", "value": true}]` | emergency stop — the mock raises an alarm event |
| `read_events` | *(none)* | one record, `message` = `Alarm active: emergency stop`, `severity` 700 |
| `write_opcua_nodes` | `nodes` = `[{"node_id": "ns=2;i=26", "value": true}]` | reset — the next `read_events` shows `Alarm cleared` |
| `list_active_alarms` | *(none)* | a clear *ConditionRefresh failed…* error: python-opcua has no condition model. Point at the alarms mock below for the working path |

The **Resources** tab lists one resource, `opcua://subscriptions`. Read it while
a subscription is running and it carries the same records as `list_subscriptions`
— that is the point of it: re-readable live state, no tool call spent.

### CLI mode (scriptable, no browser)

```bash
URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/
BIN="npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node packages/server-node/build/index.js -e OPCUA_SERVER_URL=$URL -e OPCUA_PROFILE=full -e OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL=true"

# list tools
$BIN --method tools/list

# list resources, and read the subscription buffer
$BIN --method resources/list
$BIN --method resources/read --uri opcua://subscriptions

# read history (note: quote node IDs because ';' is a shell separator)
$BIN --method tools/call --tool-name read_opcua_history \
     --tool-arg 'node_id=ns=2;i=3' --tool-arg 'num_values=5'

# call a method
$BIN --method tools/call --tool-name call_opcua_method \
     --tool-arg 'object_node_id=ns=2;i=27' --tool-arg 'method_node_id=ns=2;i=28' \
     --tool-arg 'arguments=["60"]'
```

For the Python server, swap the command for
`uv --directory packages/server-python run opcua-mcp-server`.

### Checking the connection, and surviving an outage

`get_server_status` answers "are we connected, to what, and is it healthy?" — and
is the first thing to reach for when another tool fails:

```bash
$BIN --method tools/call --tool-name get_server_status
```

It is also how to watch a reconnection by hand. In one terminal, leave the MCP
Inspector open against the mock; in another, stop the mock (`Ctrl-C`) and start
it again on the same endpoint. Neither MCP server needs restarting:

| Step | `get_server_status` says |
|------|--------------------------|
| While the mock is down | `connected: false`, with the refused connection under `error` |
| Once it is back | `connected: true`, and a `start_time` a few seconds old — a new session, not the old one |

Other tools report `endpoint_offline: Not connected to the OPC UA server at …:
… Call get_server_status for details.` while it is down, and start working again by
themselves. A `subscribe_opcua_nodes` made before the outage keeps its ID and
resumes delivering. Tune how hard and how long the retrying goes with
`OPCUA_RECONNECT_MAX_RETRY`, `OPCUA_RECONNECT_INITIAL_DELAY_MS`,
`OPCUA_RECONNECT_MAX_DELAY_MS` and `OPCUA_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`; the servers print
what is in force on startup:

```
Connection resilience: retries=3 backoff=1000..8000ms session-timeout=60000ms
```

The automated version of this is `tests/e2e/test_resilience_e2e.py`, which takes
a mock of its own away and gives it back.

### Alarms & Conditions, against the alarms mock

The bundled mock raises events but has no condition model, so
`list_active_alarms` and `acknowledge_alarm` need the node-opcua mock instead:

```bash
cd packages/mock-server-alarms && npm install && npm start
# READY endpoint=opc.tcp://localhost:4842/UA/Alarms temperatureNodeId=ns=1;i=1001 …
```

Point either MCP server at `opc.tcp://localhost:4842/UA/Alarms` (with
`OPCUA_PROFILE=full OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL=true` for the write and
acknowledge rows). It starts with
its `HighTemperatureAlarm` already active and unacknowledged:

| Tool | Arguments | Expected |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `list_active_alarms` | *(none)* | one record, `condition_name` = `HighTemperatureAlarm`, `acked` = `false` |
| `acknowledge_alarm` | `event_id` = *(the `event_id` above)*, `comment` = `on it` | one record, `"condition_id": "ns=1;i=1002"`, `"status": "Good"`, and `acked` is `true` next time you list |
| `write_opcua_nodes` | `nodes` = `[{"node_id": "ns=1;i=1001", "value": 20}]` | below the limit: the alarm goes inactive |
| `write_opcua_nodes` | `nodes` = `[{"node_id": "ns=1;i=1001", "value": 100}]` | above it again: a fresh, unacknowledged alarm |

---

## 3. AI agents

The end goal: an assistant calls these tools from natural language.

### Claude Code

Register both servers at **project scope** (writes `.mcp.json` in the repo root):

```bash
ROOT=$(pwd)
URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/
claude mcp add opcua-python -s project -e OPCUA_SERVER_URL=$URL \
  -- uv --directory "$ROOT/packages/server-python" run opcua-mcp-server
claude mcp add opcua-node -s project -e OPCUA_SERVER_URL=$URL \
  -- node "$ROOT/packages/server-node/build/index.js"
```

Then, in a **new** Claude Code session started in this directory:

1. Approve `opcua-python` / `opcua-node` when prompted (project servers require
   one-time approval). You can also manage them with the `/mcp` command.
2. Run `/mcp` to confirm both are **connected** and list their tools.
3. Ask away — example prompts:
   - *"List the OPC UA tools you have available."*
   - *"Read the current temperature from the OPC UA server."*
   - *"Show me the last 5 temperature history readings."* → `read_opcua_history`
   - *"Give me a full inventory of all variables on the server."*
   - *"Watch the tank level for the next 30 seconds and tell me what it did."* → `subscribe_opcua_nodes` / `list_subscriptions`
   - *"Start production at 60 units/hour, check the system mode, then stop it."*
   - *"Watch for events, trigger the emergency stop, then tell me what came in."*
   - *"What alarms are active, and can you acknowledge the temperature one?"*
     (needs the alarms mock — see above)
   - *"Use the opcua-node server to read node ns=2;i=4 history between 11:00 and 12:00 UTC today."*

> Both servers expose the same tool names (namespaced `opcua-python` /
> `opcua-node`); name a server in your prompt to target one specifically.

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS) and restart the app:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opcua-node": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/OPCUA-MCP/packages/server-node/build/index.js"],
      "env": { "OPCUA_SERVER_URL": "opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/" }
    }
  }
}
```

Or let the server write that block for you, which also saves getting the absolute
paths right:

```bash
cd packages/server-node && npm run build
node build/index.js --install claude-desktop \
  --url opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ --dry-run
```

Drop `--dry-run` to write it. See [install.md](install.md) for the full flag set.

### Cursor

Add the same `mcpServers` block to your Cursor MCP settings (Settings → MCP), then
ask Cursor's assistant the prompts above.

## 4. A secured connection by hand

The suite covers this automatically (`tests/e2e/test_secure_connection_e2e.py`),
but running it yourself is the quickest way to see what your MCP client will
show — and the closest local rehearsal for pointing a server at real equipment.

```bash
# 1. throwaway certificates (server + client), into a directory of your choice
uv run --no-sync python tests/fixtures/pki.py /tmp/opcua-pki

# 2. the secured mock: Basic256Sha256 only, username operator / hunter2.
#    --check-client-uri adds the ApplicationUri check real servers make; the
#    e2e fixture starts it the same way.
uv run --no-sync python tests/fixtures/secure_opcua_server.py \
  --endpoint opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4843/mcp/secure \
  --cert /tmp/opcua-pki/server.pem --key /tmp/opcua-pki/server_key.pem \
  --uri urn:opcua-mcp:test-server --check-client-uri
```

Then, in another shell, point either server at it:

```bash
export OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4843/mcp/secure
export OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY=Basic256Sha256
export OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/opcua-pki/client.pem
export OPCUA_CLIENT_KEY=/tmp/opcua-pki/client_key.pem
export OPCUA_USERNAME=operator OPCUA_PASSWORD=hunter2

npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node packages/server-node/build/index.js
# or the Python server:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory packages/server-python run opcua-mcp-server
```

No `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI`: both runtimes announce the `subjectAltName` URI of
the client certificate (`urn:opcua-mcp:test-client` here), and the mock refuses
any other — as equipment that checks does.

The server logs `Connected to OPC UA server (policy=Basic256Sha256
mode=SignAndEncrypt user="operator")` on stderr; `Temperature` is `ns=2;i=2`.
Worth trying deliberately wrong: drop `OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY` (no endpoint to
fall back to), or change the password (`BadUserAccessDenied`).

**Against real equipment this is not the whole story.** The mock accepts any
client certificate; a real server keeps a trust list and will reject yours until
an operator moves it into the trusted folder — usually after one failed
connection puts it in the rejected folder. Expect to do that first connection by
hand. Generating a certificate that real servers accept, and the trust dance
itself, are in [certificates.md](certificates.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| **List Tools is empty or errors** | Mock server not running → `uv run --no-sync opcua-mock-server` |
| **`read_opcua_history` refused with `capability_not_supported`** | The server keeps no history, or wrong `OPCUA_SERVER_URL`. With `aggregate_function` it is expected against the bundled mock, which offers no aggregates |
| **`read_events` returns nothing** | Nothing has been raised since the last read. The bundled mock only raises an event when its alarm state *changes* — write `true` to `ns=2;i=25`, then to `ns=2;i=26` |
| **`list_active_alarms` reports `ConditionRefresh failed`** | The server implements no Alarms & Conditions. Expected against the bundled mock; use `packages/mock-server-alarms` |
| **`Address already in use` on :4840** | Another mock is on the default port; stop it (`lsof -tiTCP:4840 -sTCP:LISTEN \| xargs kill`) or pass `--endpoint`. The test suite is unaffected — it picks its own port. |
| **Project MCP servers `⏸ Pending approval`** | Normal — approve them in a new `claude` session or via `/mcp` |
| **Server exits at once with `Configuration error: …`** | A security variable is set to a combination OPC UA cannot honour; the message names the variable to fix |
| **`BadUserAccessDenied` / `BadIdentityTokenRejected` on every tool** | `OPCUA_USERNAME` / `OPCUA_PASSWORD` rejected by the server |
| **`BadSecurityChecksFailed`, or the server refuses the session** | The client certificate is not in the OPC UA server's trust list — see [certificates.md](certificates.md) |
| **`BadCertificateUriInvalid`** | The announced ApplicationUri is not the certificate's `subjectAltName` URI. A conflicting `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI` is refused locally before connecting (`OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI=… does not match the subjectAltName URI of OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT`); unset it |
| **Values "snap back" after a write** | Expected — the mock republishes sensor/actuator state every ~1s; use command variables/methods for lasting changes |
| **Node value lags after a method call** | The mock propagates method effects via its 1 Hz loop; re-read after ~1s |
| **Works in the terminal, fails in Claude Desktop** | Desktop apps do not inherit a login shell's `PATH`, so a bare `"command": "npx"` or `"node"` cannot be found. Use absolute paths — `--install claude-desktop` writes them for you |
| **macOS refuses to run a downloaded executable** | Unless the release notes say it is notarized, it is ad-hoc signed only: [verify it](install.md#verifying-a-download), then `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>` |
