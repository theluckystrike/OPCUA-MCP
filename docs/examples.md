# OPC UA MCP — Tool Usage Examples

Concrete, tested examples for every tool exposed by the Python and Node MCP
servers, driven against the mock **Industrial Control System** OPC UA server.
Outputs below are real (abbreviated) responses captured end-to-end.

## Quick start

```bash
# 0) One-time: set up the Python workspace (from the repo root)
uv sync --all-packages

# 1) Start the mock OPC UA server (the simulated PLC/sensors)
uv run --no-sync opcua-mock-server        # listens on opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/

# 2a) Python MCP server
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ uv run --no-sync opcua-mcp-server

# 2b) Node MCP server
cd packages/server-node && npm install && npm run build
OPCUA_SERVER_URL=opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/ node build/index.js
```

Both read the endpoint from `OPCUA_SERVER_URL` (default `opc.tcp://localhost:4840`).

## Tools at a glance

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: tool-index from contract/tools.json by packages/server-node/scripts/config-artifacts.mjs. Do not edit by hand: edit the source, then run `npm run config:generate` in packages/server-node. -->

Both runtimes expose the same **15 tools** — 7 read, 4 monitor, 2 alarm-action and 2 control — defined once in [`contract/tools.json`](../contract/tools.json).

| Tool | Access | Hints | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`read_opcua_nodes`](#read_opcua_nodes) | read | read-only, idempotent | Read the current value of one or more OPC UA nodes in a single request. |
| [`browse_opcua_nodes`](#browse_opcua_nodes) | read | read-only, idempotent | Explore the OPC UA address space: list a node's children, walk a subtree, resolve a human-readable browse path to a node ID, or search for nodes by name. |
| [`read_opcua_history`](#read_opcua_history-both-servers) † | read | read-only, idempotent | Read what a node's value has been over time. |
| [`read_event_history`](#read_event_history) † | read | read-only, idempotent | Read events the OPC UA server stored, for a time range that has already passed. |
| [`get_server_status`](#get_server_status) | read | read-only, idempotent | Report whether this MCP server is connected to the OPC UA server and what that server says about itself: its endpoint and connection security, its ServerStatus (state, current time, start time, build info) and its NamespaceArray as index -> URI. |
| [`list_subscriptions`](#list_subscriptions) | read | read-only, idempotent | List the active OPC UA data-change subscriptions, each with the value changes buffered for it since it was created. |
| [`list_active_alarms`](#list_active_alarms) | read | read-only, idempotent | List the alarm and condition instances the server is currently retaining — those that are active, unacknowledged, or both. |
| [`subscribe_opcua_nodes`](#subscribe_opcua_nodes) | monitor | — | Watch one or more OPC UA nodes for value changes instead of polling them. |
| [`unsubscribe_opcua_nodes`](#unsubscribe_opcua_nodes) | monitor | — | Cancel one or more active data-change subscriptions and discard what they had buffered. |
| [`subscribe_events`](#subscribe_events) | monitor | — | Start buffering OPC UA events (alarms, condition changes, plain events) from a notifier node. |
| [`read_events`](#read_events) | monitor | — | Read the events buffered by subscribe_events, oldest first. |
| [`acknowledge_alarm`](#acknowledge_alarm) | alarm-action | — | Acknowledge an alarm or condition, identified by the event_id of the event that reported it (from list_active_alarms or read_events). |
| [`act_on_alarm`](#act_on_alarm) | alarm-action | — | Confirm, annotate or shelve an alarm — the rest of the operator workflow that acknowledge_alarm starts. |
| [`write_opcua_nodes`](#write_opcua_nodes) | control | destructive, idempotent | Write a value to one or more OPC UA nodes. |
| [`call_opcua_method`](#call_opcua_method) | control | destructive | Call a method on an OPC UA object. |

**Access** decides which `OPCUA_PROFILE` offers a tool. `read` and `monitor` tools are offered under every profile, including the default `observe`. `control` tools need `operator`, which offers them only for allowlisted targets, or `full`; `alarm-action` tools need `operator` with `OPCUA_ALLOW_ACKNOWLEDGE_ALARMS`, or `full`. Both also need a verified server — a secured channel and a pinned `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT` — unless a lab override is set: `OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL` for a channel with no security, `OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL` for an unpinned server. **Hints** are the MCP tool annotations each tool advertises.

† **Needs a server feature**: always listed, and refused at call time with `capability_not_supported` or `capability_unknown` when the connected server does not advertise what it needs — `read_opcua_history` on `AccessHistoryDataCapability` or `AggregateFunctions`; `read_event_history` on `AccessHistoryEventsCapability`.

## Partial results: `completeness`

Seven of the tools can return fewer records than their request covered, and every one of
them says so as a field — `completeness`, beside `result` in `structuredContent`
(issue #137) — on every call, not only when something is missing:

```json
{ "result": [ … ],
  "completeness": { "complete": false, "reasons": ["requestLimit"], "returned": 2,
                    "truncated": true, "limit": 2, "dropped": 0, "remaining": true,
                    "continuation": { "start_time": "2026-09-24T10:00:01.123Z" } } }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `complete` | `true` only when `result` is the whole answer and nothing was lost. **Test this; never infer completeness from how many records came back.** |
| `reasons` | Why not, one entry per cause: `requestLimit` (a count you asked for — `num_values`, `limit`, `max_nodes` — was reached), `contractLimit` (this server's own cap was reached), `serverLimit` (the OPC UA server stopped early with a continuation point), `bufferOverflow` (a buffer discarded records before the read), `unbrowsable` (part of the address space could not be listed). |
| `returned` | Records in `result` (nodes, for a browse). |
| `truncated` / `limit` | Whether a cap stopped the response, and that cap's size when it is known. |
| `dropped` | Records a bounded buffer discarded before this read — gone for good. |
| `remaining` | `true` when more can be fetched, `false` when nothing is left, `null` when a cap was reached and nothing says whether more exists. |
| `continuation` | Arguments to merge into the same call to get the rest. `{}` means call again unchanged (`read_events`); `{"start_time": …}` continues a forward history read, inclusive of the boundary record. `null` when a read cannot be resumed from its arguments — a browse, an aggregate, or a history read with no `start_time`, which runs newest first. |

`continuation` is plain arguments rather than a token the server holds, so it
cannot go stale, is tied to no session and survives a reconnect. The tools that
carry it: `read_opcua_history`, `read_event_history`, `read_events`,
`browse_opcua_nodes`, `subscribe_opcua_nodes`, `list_subscriptions`,
`unsubscribe_opcua_nodes`. The trailing text notices (a buffer overflowed, a
history cap was reached) are still appended for text-only clients; they now
repeat what `completeness` says rather than being the only place it is said.

## Limits

Every request is bounded before it reaches the OPC UA server, and one over a
bound is refused whole — never truncated, never partly sent — with a message
naming the limit and the value:

```
write_opcua_nodes accepts at most 100 entries in nodes, got 101. Nothing was sent to the OPC UA server; split the request.
write_opcua_nodes argument nodes[0].value is a string of 131073 bytes, over the 131072-byte limit on one string (limits.maxStringBytes). Nothing was sent to the OPC UA server.
```

The numbers are in `../contract/tools.json` -> `limits` and in the
[tools reference](tools.md#how-much-one-call-may-ask-for). The connected server's own
`OperationLimits` can only lower them: reads go out in chunks of its
`MaxNodesPerRead`, and a write batch over its `MaxNodesPerWrite` is refused rather
than split. The bundled mock publishes 100 and 50, so both happen against it.

## Core tools (both servers)

### `read_opcua_nodes`
Read one or more nodes. One call, one round trip, whether it is one node or fifty.
```json
{ "node_ids": ["ns=2;i=3", "ns=2;i=4", "ns=2;i=12"] }
```
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "value": 26.13, "data_type": "Double", "status": "Good",
  "source_timestamp": "2026-09-10T13:15:12.214Z",
  "server_timestamp": "2026-09-10T13:15:12.214Z", "engineering": null }
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=4", "value": 1010.57, "data_type": "Double", … }
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=12", "value": false, "data_type": "Boolean", … }
```
The quality and the age come with the value, because they are what decide whether
it can be acted on: a `status` of `Good` and a `source_timestamp` from four hours
ago are a stale reading, and a bare number cannot tell you that.

A standard namespace-zero structured value (an `ExtensionObject`, such as
`Range` or `EUInformation`) is a JSON object with the original UA field names:
`{"Low": -50, "High": 250}`. Nested structures and arrays preserve their fields;
LocalizedText fields carry both `Locale` and `Text`. A server-defined or opaque
structure that cannot be decoded carries
`{"$opcua": "undecodableExtensionObject"}`. Treat that marker as unavailable
structured data, even when the OPC UA read status is `Good`.

`engineering` is what the plant says the number *means*, read from the node's own
OPC UA properties (Part 8 §5.3) and cached for the session. `null` for a node that
publishes none, which is most of them:

```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=90", "value": 50.0, "data_type": "Double", "status": "Good",
  "engineering": { "unit": "°C", "unit_description": "degree Celsius",
                   "eu_range": { "low": 0, "high": 150 },
                   "instrument_range": { "low": -50, "high": 250 } }, … }
```

`eu_range` is what the value holds in normal operation, `instrument_range` what
the device can physically return. The first is not only reported — a write
outside it is refused before anything is sent.

A node the server rejects is one `Bad…` status among the others, never a failed
call — one unreadable node must not discard the other forty-nine.

At most 500 nodes per call. A server that publishes a lower `MaxNodesPerRead` is
sent the list in consecutive Reads, and the records still come back in the order
asked, each with its own status.

A Good *subcode* is still a value. `GoodLocalOverride`, `GoodClamped` and the
rest are successes that say something more, so the value is returned and the
subcode named, and you can see that someone overrode the node locally:
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;s=OverriddenSetpoint", "value": 42.5, "data_type": "Double",
  "status": "GoodLocalOverride", … }
```
> Prompt: *"Read temperature, pressure, and pump status together."*

### `write_opcua_nodes`
Write one or more nodes. **This changes physical equipment.**
```json
{ "nodes": [
  { "node_id": "ns=2;i=13", "value": 80 },
  { "node_id": "ns=2;i=24", "value": true }
] }
```
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=13", "status": "Good", "error": null }
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=24", "status": "Good", "error": null }
```
Without `data_type` each node is read first to learn its type. Give it to skip
that round trip — and to write a **write-only** node, which refuses the read:
```json
{ "nodes": [{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=13", "value": 80, "data_type": "Double" }] }
```
`status` is what the OPC UA server answered; `error` is why this server never
sent the write at all (an unconvertible value, a type it could not read). The two
are separate because "the server refused" and "we never asked" are different
problems with different fixes.

**A batch is not a transaction.** OPC UA lets some writes in one Write land while
others are refused, and nothing is rolled back — read each `status`. At most 100
writes per call, and fewer where the server publishes a lower `MaxNodesPerWrite`:
a batch over either is refused before anything is sent rather than split, because
splitting would add the case where the first half moved the plant and the second
never arrived.

Conversion is strict, and the same on both runtimes
(`../tests/fixtures/write-coercion.json` is the full table). A numeric string must
look like a JSON number, so `"42.5"` and `"1e3"` work and `"0x2A"`, `"1_000"`
and `""` do not. `true` is not 1, `[5]` is not 5, and a String node takes only a
string. A DateTime needs a timezone:
```json
{ "nodes": [
  { "node_id": "ns=2;i=41", "value": "0x10" },
  { "node_id": "ns=2;i=41", "value": "2026-04-23T17:40:00", "data_type": "DateTime" }
] }
```
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=41", "status": "BadTypeMismatch",
  "error": "Cannot convert \"0x10\" to Double" }
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=41", "status": "BadTypeMismatch",
  "error": "Invalid date/time: \"2026-04-23T17:40:00\" has no timezone, so the instant it names depends on where it is read. Add Z for UTC or an offset such as +02:00, e.g. 2026-04-23T17:40:00Z" }
```
An Int64 or UInt64 larger than ±2^53−1 has to be sent as a decimal string
(`"9223372036854775807"`), because a JSON number that large has already been
rounded before it arrives.
> Note: the simulation republishes sensor/actuator state every ~1s, so direct
> writes to those nodes are transient. Use the **command variables** or
> **methods** to drive lasting state changes.
> Prompt: *"Open valve V-101 to 80%."*

### `browse_opcua_nodes`
Explore the address space: list children, walk a subtree, resolve a path by name,
or search. One tool for all four, because they are one traversal with different
bounds.

**List a node's children** (the default, `depth: 1`):
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=1" }
```
```json
{ "nodes": [
    { "node_id": "ns=2;i=2", "browse_name": "2:Sensors", "node_class": "Object",
      "parent_node_id": "ns=2;i=1", "data_type": null, "value": null,
      "description": null, "type_definition": "FolderType" },
    { "node_id": "ns=2;i=11", "browse_name": "2:Actuators", … },
    { "node_id": "ns=2;i=27", "browse_name": "2:Methods", … }, … ],
  "truncated": false, "inspected": 5 }
```
> Prompt: *"What folders are under the Industrial Control System?"*

**Inventory every variable** (what the retired `get_all_variables` did):
```json
{ "depth": 4, "node_class": "Variable", "include_values": true }
```
```json
{ "nodes": [
    { "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "browse_name": "2:Temperature", "node_class": "Variable",
      "parent_node_id": "ns=2;i=2", "data_type": "Double", "value": 26.5,
      "description": "Temperature", "type_definition": "BaseDataVariableType" },
    { "node_id": "ns=2;i=90", "browse_name": "2:ScratchAnalog", "node_class": "Variable",
      "parent_node_id": "ns=2;i=40", "data_type": "Double", "value": 50,
      "description": "ScratchAnalog", "type_definition": "AnalogItemType" }, … ],
  "truncated": false, "inspected": 39 }
```
`type_definition` is what a node *is*, as against what class it belongs to. The
two variables above are both `Variable` and both Double, and only the second one
will answer with a unit and a range — `AnalogItemType` is the difference, and
`node_class` cannot express it. The same holds for Objects, more strongly: an
alarm and the folder holding it are both `Object`, and only
`ExclusiveLimitAlarmType` says which one `act_on_alarm` applies to.

It costs one batched browse for the whole result rather than one per node, and
it is `null` for a node class that has no type (a Method, a View) and for a node
whose type could not be read.

The built-in `Server` subtree is always skipped — several hundred nodes of the
server describing itself, identical everywhere, and `get_server_status` answers
what anyone would browse it for.
> Prompt: *"Give me a complete inventory of everything on this server."*

**Resolve a name to a node id** (`depth: 0` returns just the addressed node):
```json
{ "browse_path": "/Objects/IndustrialControlSystem/Sensors/Temperature", "depth": 0 }
```
```json
{ "nodes": [ { "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "browse_name": "2:Temperature", … } ],
  "truncated": false, "inspected": 1 }
```
This is where to start when you know what a thing is *called* but not its numeric
id. A bare segment matches whatever namespace it is in; write `2:Sensors` to pin
one. A path that does not resolve is an error naming the segment that failed, not
an empty result.

**Search by name:**
```json
{ "depth": 4, "name_filter": "temp" }
```
> Prompt: *"Find me anything to do with temperature."*

**`truncated` is part of the answer.** Every walk is bounded by `max_nodes`
(default 500), and a walk that stopped early says so — a prefix of the address
space is otherwise indistinguishable from all of it. `completeness` says the same
beside the result, and adds what `truncated` cannot: a node below the root that
refused to list its children, whose subtree is then missing.
```json
{ "complete": false, "reasons": ["requestLimit"], "returned": 2, "truncated": true,
  "limit": 2, "dropped": 0, "remaining": true, "continuation": null }
```

### `call_opcua_method`
Call a method on an object node.
```json
{ "object_node_id": "ns=2;i=27", "method_node_id": "ns=2;i=28", "arguments": ["60"] }
```
```json
{ "object_node_id": "ns=2;i=27", "method_node_id": "ns=2;i=28",
  "status": "Good", "outputs": [true] }
```
Arguments are converted to the types the method *declares*: this server reads the
method's `InputArguments`, so a Boolean argument is sent as a Boolean and an
Int32 as an Int32, rather than everything becoming a Double or a String.

A declared type derived from a built-in one is sent as that built-in type. The
mock's `EchoDuration` takes a `Duration` (`i=290`), which is a Double on the wire,
and answers with what it received:
```json
{ "object_node_id": "ns=2;i=27", "method_node_id": "ns=2;s=EchoDuration",
  "arguments": ["1500"] }
```
```json
{ "object_node_id": "ns=2;i=27", "method_node_id": "ns=2;s=EchoDuration",
  "status": "Good", "outputs": ["Double:1500.0"] }
```
A method that publishes no `InputArguments` gets its arguments by JSON type: a
boolean is sent as a Boolean, a number or numeric string as a Double, and any other
string as a String. `null`, arrays and objects have no obvious OPC UA type, so
they are refused before the call is sent. `status` is what the server answered,
including a Good subcode such as `GoodClamped`.
After this, `SystemMode` (`ns=2;i=19`) becomes `AUTO` and `ProductionRate`
(`ns=2;i=21`) becomes `60` within ~1s.
> Prompt: *"Start production at 60 units/hour, then stop it."*

### `get_server_status`
Connection state, server health, and the namespace array — the first thing to try
when another tool fails.
```json
{}
```
```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "endpoint_url": "opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/",
  "security": "policy=None mode=None user=anonymous",
  "server_identity": {
    "channel_secured": false,
    "server_authenticated": false,
    "authentication_method": "none",
    "control": "blocked"
  },
  "server_state": "Running",
  "current_time": "2026-09-17T13:06:37.580Z",
  "start_time": "2026-09-17T13:06:10.558Z",
  "build_info": {
    "product_name": "FreeOpcUa Python Server",
    "product_uri": "urn:freeopcua.github.io:python:server",
    "manufacturer_name": "FreeOpcUa",
    "software_version": "1.0pre",
    "build_number": "0",
    "build_date": "2026-09-17T13:06:10.558Z"
  },
  "namespaces": [
    { "index": 0, "uri": "http://opcfoundation.org/UA/" },
    { "index": 1, "uri": "urn:freeopcua:python:server" },
    { "index": 2, "uri": "http://examples.freeopcua.github.io" }
  ],
  "diagnostics": null,
  "error": null,
  "capabilities": {
    "session_generation": 1,
    "checked_at": "2026-09-17T13:06:12.104Z",
    "support": { "history": "supported", "historyEvents": "supported", "aggregate": "not_supported" },
    "aggregate_functions": []
  }
}
```
> Prompt: *"Are we actually connected, and is the PLC healthy?"*

`capabilities` answers "why was that history read refused?": what the server was
found to offer, on which of this process's sessions and when. Every tool is
listed whatever it says; a call that needs something `not_supported` is refused
with `capability_not_supported` and what to use instead.

`server_identity` answers "why can't it write?" before anyone asks. Encrypted and
authenticated are separate properties: `channel_secured` is a security policy
other than `None`, `server_authenticated` is the server's certificate pinned with
`OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`, and control tools need both. `control` says whether the
channel gate is open and why — `secured`, `INSECURE-OVERRIDE`,
`UNVERIFIED-OVERRIDE` (a lab override, named as such) or `blocked`. It comes from
configuration, so it is there while disconnected too, and the profile and
allowlists still apply on top of it.

Use `namespaces` rather than hard-coding a namespace index: the same URI can sit
at a different index after a server restart, so an `ns=2;i=3` that worked
yesterday may address something else today.

`diagnostics` is the server's own `ServerDiagnosticsSummary`, and it is `null`
above because the Python mock does not publish one. OPC UA Part 5 makes
diagnostics optional, so plenty of real servers answer the same way — `null`
means *this server does not say*, not *zero*. The aggregate mock does publish
them, and there the same call returns:

```json
{
  "diagnostics": {
    "server_view_count": 0,
    "current_session_count": 1,
    "cumulated_session_count": 4,
    "security_rejected_session_count": 0,
    "rejected_session_count": 0,
    "session_timeout_count": 0,
    "session_abort_count": 0,
    "current_subscription_count": 2,
    "cumulated_subscription_count": 5,
    "publishing_interval_count": 1,
    "security_rejected_requests_count": 0,
    "rejected_requests_count": 0
  }
}
```
> Prompt: *"Is the server refusing connections, or is it just slow for us?"*

These twelve counters answer the questions someone asks about a server they
cannot see. `rejected_session_count` and `security_rejected_session_count`
separate "the server is turning connections away" from "our credentials are
wrong" — a distinction that otherwise takes a site visit.
`cumulated_session_count` climbing far above `current_session_count` means
something is connecting and dropping in a loop.
`current_subscription_count` against `publishing_interval_count` shows whether
many subscriptions are sharing one publishing cycle. They are read in the same
batch as the status and the namespaces, so none of this costs an extra round
trip.

This is the one tool that never fails for being disconnected — it reports it:

```json
{
  "connected": false,
  "endpoint_url": "opc.tcp://localhost:4840",
  "security": "policy=None mode=None user=anonymous",
  "server_identity": {
    "channel_secured": false,
    "server_authenticated": false,
    "authentication_method": "none",
    "control": "blocked"
  },
  "server_state": null,
  "current_time": null,
  "start_time": null,
  "build_info": null,
  "namespaces": [],
  "diagnostics": null,
  "error": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4840",
  "capabilities": {
    "session_generation": null,
    "checked_at": null,
    "support": { "history": "unknown", "historyEvents": "unknown", "aggregate": "unknown" },
    "aggregate_functions": []
  }
}
```

Calling it is also what re-establishes a dropped connection, so it doubles as
"try again now". See [Staying connected](configuration.md#staying-connected).

## History and aggregates

One tool, always listed with every argument. It needs a server that keeps
history or computes aggregates, and a call the connected server cannot serve is
refused with `capability_not_supported` before anything is sent. The mock server
enables history and advertises no aggregate functions, so against it a raw read
works and an aggregate read is refused.

### `read_opcua_history` (both servers)
Read a node's stored history — raw readings, or one server-computed summary per
interval. Served when the server advertises historical access
(`AccessHistoryDataCapability`) *or* aggregates.

```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "start_time": "2026-06-05T09:50:00Z",
  "end_time": "2026-06-05T10:30:00Z", "num_values": 3 }
```

`start_time` and `end_time` are RFC 3339 and must carry a timezone, `Z` or an
offset such as `+02:00`. A timestamp with none is refused rather than read as
UTC or as the server host's local time, because either guess can silently move
the window by hours. The full grammar is `../tests/fixtures/datetime-parsing.json`.
A range with nothing in it (the server answers `GoodNoData`) comes back as an
empty result, not an error.

Both servers answer with the same records — one per historical value, returned
as one content block each:

```json
{ "value": 26.01, "timestamp": "2026-06-05T09:55:03.382Z", "status": "Good" }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `value` | The recorded value, encoded per its OPC UA data type — a number stays a number, a ByteString is base64, a DateTime is ISO-8601 UTC, a NodeId is `ns=2;i=3`. `null` for an interval with no data. The full table is `../tests/fixtures/value-encoding.json`. |
| `timestamp` | Source timestamp, ISO-8601 UTC — the same format `start_time`/`end_time` accept. |
| `status` | OPC UA status code name, e.g. `Good`, `BadNoData`. |

The shape is defined once, in `../contract/tools.json` under
`resultShapes.historyRecords`, and both servers are held to it by
`../tests/e2e/test_contract_parity.py`. Earlier versions of the Node server
returned raw `DataValue` JSON here instead
(`{"statusCode": {"value": 0}, "sourceTimestamp": …}`); see `../CHANGELOG.md`.

`completeness` says whether that was the whole range. Asking for 3 readings of a
range that holds more:
```json
{ "complete": false, "reasons": ["requestLimit"], "returned": 3, "truncated": true,
  "limit": 3, "dropped": 0, "remaining": true,
  "continuation": { "start_time": "2026-06-05T09:55:05.391Z" } }
```
Merge `continuation` into the same arguments and call again for the next page;
it starts at the last record returned, inclusive, so drop that one by timestamp.
Without a `start_time` the server reads newest first and `continuation` is
`null` — give a `start_time` to page forward. A read that stops at the 5000 cap
also appends a one-line notice for text-only clients.

> Prompt: *"Show the last 5 temperature readings from history."*

#### With an aggregate
Add `aggregate_function` and the server computes one summary value per
`processing_interval` (ms) instead of returning raw readings — which is how to
ask about a week of data without transferring a week of data.
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "start_time": "2026-06-05T09:50:00Z",
  "aggregate_function": "Average", "processing_interval": 60000 }
```

**The argument is always listed; the server decides whether it can be used.**
Which functions a server offers is its own choice: `get_server_status` →
`capabilities.aggregate_functions` lists them, and an unknown name is refused
with that list. The bundled mock offers none, so against it the call is refused
before anything is sent:

```text
capability_not_supported: read_opcua_history needs aggregate functions (AggregateFunctions, ns=0;i=2997), and the OPC UA server at opc.tcp://… does not offer it (determined on session generation 1 at 2026-09-24T10:00:00.000Z). Nothing was sent. Call read_opcua_history without aggregate_function for the raw readings and summarise them yourself, over a range short enough to stay under the per-call maximum.
```

The catalogue used to hide the argument on such a server instead, which made the
schema a client cached depend on which server it had listed against, and when
(#140).

The result uses the same record shape as the raw read above, one record per
interval:

```json
{ "value": 25.83, "timestamp": "2026-06-05T09:50:00.000Z", "status": "Good" }
```

The number of intervals is bounded like a raw read, at 5000 — a 1 ms interval
over an hour is 3.6 million records, and is refused before it is sent.

> Prompt: *"What was the average temperature per minute over the last hour?"*

---

## Data-change subscriptions

Added for issue #3. Available on both servers, against any OPC UA server —
unlike history and aggregates, these are not capability-gated.

An MCP tool call is request/response, so a subscription cannot call the agent
back: the OPC UA notifications arrive whenever the server decides to publish,
long after `subscribe_opcua_nodes` has returned. So the MCP server **buffers**
them. You subscribe once, then read the accumulated values back whenever you
like — from `list_subscriptions` or from the `opcua://subscriptions` resource.

### `subscribe_opcua_nodes`
Start watching one or more nodes. Each gets its own subscription record and id.
```json
{ "node_ids": ["ns=2;i=3"], "publishing_interval": 500,
  "sampling_interval": 0, "buffer_size": 20 }
```
```json
{ "subscription_id": "sub-1", "node_id": "ns=2;i=3",
  "publishing_interval": 500, "sampling_interval": 500,
  "buffer_size": 20, "change_count": 0,
  "deadband_type": "none", "deadband_value": 0,
  "data_change_trigger": "statusValue", "changes": [], "dropped": 0 }
```

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `node_ids` | — | The nodes to monitor. A single node is a one-element list. |
| `publishing_interval` | `1000` | How often (ms) the OPC UA server publishes queued changes. Clamped to at least 50. |
| `sampling_interval` | `0` | How often (ms) it samples the node. `0` means "sample at `publishing_interval`", and the record reports the rate actually in force. A shorter interval queues several readings per publish. |
| `buffer_size` | `20` | How many of the most recent changes to retain. Clamped to 1..1000; older changes are discarded. |
| `deadband_type` | `none` | `absolute` reports a change only when it moves further than `deadband_value` in engineering units; `percent` reads that value as a percentage of the node's `EURange`. |
| `deadband_value` | — | Required when `deadband_type` is not `none`. Refused if omitted rather than defaulted to zero, which would be a deadband that filters nothing. |
| `data_change_trigger` | `statusValue` | `status` reports only OPC UA status transitions; `statusValueTimestamp` also reports a re-sample that changed nothing but the timestamp. |

**Filter a noisy tag at the server, not here.** Without a deadband the default
20-record ring fills with sensor jitter in about a second, and the agent reads
back nothing but noise. The discarded values never leave the OPC UA server, so
this costs no bandwidth and no buffer:

```json
{ "node_ids": ["ns=2;i=90"], "deadband_type": "percent", "deadband_value": 2 }
```

> A percent deadband is a percentage of the node's `EURange`, so it needs a node
> that publishes one — `ns=2;i=90` on the mock does, 0 to 150, making 2% three
> degrees. A node that publishes none is refused rather than quietly given an
> absolute deadband.

> An OPC UA server sends the node's **current value** as the first change, so
> `change_count` reaches 1 without the value having moved.
> Prompt: *"Watch the temperature sensor, but only tell me about moves over half a degree."*

### `list_subscriptions`
Every active subscription and what it has collected since.
```json
{}
```
```json
{ "subscription_id": "sub-1", "node_id": "ns=2;i=3",
  "publishing_interval": 500, "sampling_interval": 500,
  "buffer_size": 20, "change_count": 4,
  "deadband_type": "none", "deadband_value": 0,
  "data_change_trigger": "statusValue",
  "changes": [
    { "value": 25.33, "timestamp": "2026-09-12T08:24:11.478Z", "status": "Good" },
    { "value": 26.05, "timestamp": "2026-09-12T08:24:12.481Z", "status": "Good" },
    { "value": 24.23, "timestamp": "2026-09-12T08:24:13.484Z", "status": "Good" },
    { "value": 24.75, "timestamp": "2026-09-12T08:24:14.486Z", "status": "Good" } ],
  "dropped": 0 }
```

One record per subscription, one content block each — the same framing as
`read_opcua_history`, and each entry of `changes` is a `historyRecords`
record. `change_count` counts every change received; `changes` holds only the
newest `buffer_size` of them, and `dropped` is how many were discarded to make
room — so a trend read from `changes` knows whether it starts late.
`completeness.dropped` totals it over every subscription returned.

> Prompt: *"What has the temperature done since I asked you to watch it?"*

### `unsubscribe_opcua_nodes`
Cancel subscriptions and discard their buffers.
```json
{ "subscription_ids": ["sub-1"] }
```
```json
{ "subscription_id": "sub-1", "node_id": "ns=2;i=3",
  "publishing_interval": 500, "sampling_interval": 500,
  "buffer_size": 20, "change_count": 4, "changes": [ … ] }
```
The subscription is returned as it was at the moment it was cancelled, so
anything still buffered can be read one last time rather than being thrown away
with it.

Every id is checked before any is cancelled, so an ID that is not active cancels
nothing — a typo must not cost the buffers of the subscriptions named beside it:
```
No such subscription: sub-9
```

> Subscriptions do not outlive the MCP session. Both servers tear every one of
> them down before closing the OPC UA session, so a client that reconnects
> starts from none.

### Resource: `opcua://subscriptions`
The same records, re-readable without spending a tool call. `mimeType` is
`application/json`, and the document has one key:
```json
{ "subscriptions": [
  { "subscription_id": "sub-1", "node_id": "ns=2;i=3", "publishing_interval": 500,
    "sampling_interval": 500, "buffer_size": 20, "change_count": 4,
    "changes": [ { "value": 25.33, "timestamp": "2026-09-12T08:24:11.478Z", "status": "Good" } ] } ] }
```

Neither server sends `notifications/resources/updated`, and neither advertises
`resources.subscribe` — the agent re-reads. See
[architecture.md](architecture.md#why-the-subscriptions-resource-is-polled-not-pushed)
for why.

---

## Events & alarms

Added for issue #4, and not capability-gated either: any OPC UA server has a
Server object that events are raised from, and one that raises none simply has
none to hand over. Alarms are the same machinery with a condition attached.

The one exception is `read_event_history`, which *is* gated — keeping an archive
of past events is optional in a way that raising them is not, and a server that
does not keep one has nothing to read rather than nothing to report.

### `subscribe_events`
Start collecting events. Returns immediately — the subscription runs in the
background, because MCP has no way for the server to push one at you.
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=0;i=2253", "severity_min": 500, "buffer_size": 100 }
```
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=0;i=2253", "severity_min": 500, "buffer_size": 100, "replaced": false }
```
Every argument is optional: the default notifier is the Server object
(`ns=0;i=2253`), where most servers raise everything they have. Subscribing to
the same node again restarts it with the new settings.
> Prompt: *"Watch for anything serious happening on the plant."*

### `read_events`
Hand over what has arrived, oldest first. The events returned are **removed**
from the buffer, so a second call returns only what is new.
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=0;i=2253", "limit": 50 }
```
One content block per event:
```json
{ "event_id": "ZDAzNzVmNzlhYzM0NDNjMWI3MzdhMmJhMmRmNzFiN2E=",
  "event_type": "ns=0;i=2041", "source_node": "ns=2;i=1",
  "source_name": "IndustrialControlSystem", "time": "2026-09-12T08:36:07.280Z",
  "message": "Alarm active: emergency stop", "severity": 700,
  "condition_id": null, "condition_name": null,
  "active": null, "acked": null, "retain": null }
```
Every field is present on every event; the condition fields are `null` for a
plain event like this one. If the buffer overflowed since the last read, one
last block — prose, not a record — says how many events were lost and what to
raise, and `completeness` says it as fields:
```json
{ "complete": false, "reasons": ["bufferOverflow"], "returned": 1, "truncated": false,
  "limit": null, "dropped": 3, "remaining": false, "continuation": null }
```
When `limit` stops the read with more still buffered, `reasons` is
`["requestLimit"]`, `remaining` is `true` and `continuation` is `{}`: call again. The mock raises exactly this when its alarm state
changes — write `true` to `ns=2;i=25` to see it, and to `ns=2;i=26` to clear it.
> Prompt: *"Anything happen since we last looked?"*

### `read_event_history`
Events the server stored, for a range that has already passed. `subscribe_events`
only sees what arrives *after* it subscribes, so it cannot answer "what fired
overnight" — by the time anyone asks, those events are gone. This reads them back
out of the server's own archive instead.
```json
{ "start_time": "2026-09-12T08:00:00Z", "end_time": "2026-09-12T09:00:00Z",
  "severity_min": 500 }
```
```json
{ "event_id": "ZDAzNzVmNzlhYzM0NDNjMWI3MzdhMmJhMmRmNzFiN2E=",
  "event_type": "ns=0;i=2041", "source_node": "ns=2;i=1",
  "source_name": "IndustrialControlSystem", "time": "2026-09-12T08:36:07.280Z",
  "message": "Alarm active: emergency stop", "severity": 700,
  "condition_id": null, "condition_name": null,
  "active": null, "acked": null, "retain": null }
```
> Prompt: *"What alarms fired in the hour before the line stopped last night?"*

The same records as `read_events`, deliberately — an alarm looks identical
whether it was watched live or recovered afterwards, because both paths send the
same select clauses and run the same decoder. Every argument is optional: the
range defaults to the last hour, and the notifier to the Server object. The
result is capped at 5000 events; an alarm burst can be far more than that, and
asking for all of them is a request that never returns. `completeness` says when
the cap, `num_values` or the server stopped the read, and gives the `start_time`
to continue from.

Served only when the server advertises `AccessHistoryEventsCapability`
(`ns=0;i=11194`), and refused with `capability_not_supported` otherwise — listed
either way. That is a different node and a different answer from the one
`read_opcua_history` needs: OPC UA Part 11 §5.4 lets a server keep values
without keeping events, and most do.
> Prompt: *"Show me everything that happened between 2am and 3am."*

### `list_active_alarms`
The alarms the server is retaining right now — active, unacknowledged, or both.
Needs no prior `subscribe_events`: it asks the server directly, with
ConditionRefresh.
```json
{ "node_id": "ns=0;i=2253", "timeout_seconds": 5 }
```
```json
{ "event_id": "ZjW7HJrVSFzDV2sMsX7sEQAAAAE=", "event_type": "ns=0;i=9341",
  "source_node": "ns=1;i=1001", "source_name": "Temperature",
  "time": "2026-09-12T08:34:21.872Z",
  "message": "Condition is 100.000 and state is High", "severity": 700,
  "condition_id": "ns=1;i=1002", "condition_name": "HighTemperatureAlarm",
  "active": true, "acked": false, "retain": true }
```
If the server does not finish within `timeout_seconds`, that is an error too,
not a short list: a partial answer cannot be told apart from "no alarms".

Against a server with no Alarms & Conditions support — the bundled mock included
— this says so rather than returning an empty list:
```
Failed to list active alarms from node ns=0;i=2253: ConditionRefresh
failed with status: BadNothingToDo (0x800f0000). The server may not implement
OPC UA Alarms & Conditions.
```
To try the working path, run the alarms mock instead:
`cd packages/mock-server-alarms && npm install && npm start` (:4842).
> Prompt: *"What alarms are active right now?"*

### `acknowledge_alarm`
Acknowledge one, by the `event_id` that reported it. The condition behind that
event is remembered from the call that reported it, so it need not be repeated.
```json
{ "event_id": "ZjW7HJrVSFzDV2sMsX7sEQAAAAE=", "comment": "on it — checking the cooler" }
```
```json
{ "event_id": "ZjW7HJrVSFzDV2sMsX7sEQAAAAE=", "condition_id": "ns=1;i=1002", "status": "Good" }
```
Acknowledging tells the server an operator has seen the alarm. It does not clear
the underlying condition: `active` stays `true` until the plant says otherwise.
Pass `condition_id` explicitly for an event that came from somewhere other than
this server's own `read_events` / `list_active_alarms`.
> Prompt: *"Acknowledge the high-temperature alarm, note that I'm on it."*

### `act_on_alarm`
The rest of the operator workflow: confirm, annotate or shelve.
```json
{ "event_id": "ZjW7HJrVSFzDV2sMsX7sEQAAAAI=", "action": "confirm",
  "comment": "cooler restarted, temperature falling" }
```
```json
{ "event_id": "ZjW7HJrVSFzDV2sMsX7sEQAAAAI=", "condition_id": "ns=1;i=1002",
  "action": "confirm", "status": "Good" }
```

| `action` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `acknowledge` | Exactly what `acknowledge_alarm` does, so one tool can drive the whole workflow. |
| `confirm` | The second stage of the handshake: not "I have seen this" but "I have dealt with it". Needs a condition whose type declares `ConfirmedState`. |
| `comment` | Attach a note without changing the alarm's state. Every condition supports it. |
| `shelve` | Silence a chattering alarm until it returns to normal. |
| `shelveFor` | The same for `shelve_duration_ms` milliseconds, after which it comes back on its own. |
| `unshelve` | Put it back on the board immediately. |

> **Use a *current* `event_id`.** Every condition state change is its own event
> with its own `EventId`, so after acknowledging an alarm, re-read
> `list_active_alarms` for the id the acknowledgement produced before confirming
> it. A stale id is answered `BadEventIdUnknown`.

> `shelve_duration_ms` belongs to `shelveFor` and is refused on any other action —
> `shelve` means "until the alarm clears", and accepting a duration there would
> silently ignore it.

> Prompt: *"That level switch has cycled 40 times in an hour. Shelve it for half an hour."*

The record shape above is defined once, in `../contract/tools.json` under
`resultShapes.eventRecords`, with the OPC UA browse path behind each field in
the neighbouring `events.fields`. Both servers are held to it by
`../tests/e2e/test_events_e2e.py`.

## Tip

You don't call these tools by hand in normal use — you ask Claude. The JSON above
is what Claude sends under the hood. See `../tests/` for an automated suite that
exercises every tool against both servers.

Aggregate history consumes the OPC UA server’s continuation points within one
call, using the original time range and processing interval on every page.
It returns the completed range (at most 5000 values) or an explicit error if
the server stops making progress, rejects continuation, or exceeds the cap.
No partial aggregate page is presented as a successful result. Points held
at failure or cancellation are released best-effort; none are retained
across MCP calls or reconnects. Raw history keeps its stateless continuation.
