# Installing

All routes run locally over MCP stdio, with one client context and one OPC UA
endpoint per process. Configure separate MCP entries for separate endpoints.
Remote MCP service operation requires the accepted
[identity and isolation RFC](rfc/0001-remote-identity-isolation.md) to be
implemented.

Four ways in, roughly in order of how little you need already installed.

| | You need | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| [MCP bundle (`.mcpb`)](#1-mcp-bundle-mcpb--claude-desktop) | Claude Desktop | Claude Desktop users. Nothing else to install. |
| [Single-file executable](#2-single-file-executable--no-runtime-at-all) | Nothing | Locked-down or air-gapped machines; MCP clients other than Claude Desktop. |
| [`--install`](#3---install--let-the-server-write-the-config) | Node or Python | You already have a runtime and want a checked config written for you (Claude Desktop, Codex). |
| [Editing the config by hand](#4-editing-the-config-by-hand) | Node or Python | Scripted rollouts, unusual clients, or auditing exactly what runs. |

## 1. MCP bundle (`.mcpb`) — Claude Desktop

An [MCP bundle](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) is a single file
you drag into Claude Desktop. It carries the server and every dependency, Claude
Desktop supplies the Node runtime, and the OPC UA endpoint appears as a settings
field — no runtime to install, no JSON to edit, nothing fetched from the network
at startup.

1. Download `opcua-mcp-server-<version>.mcpb` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/releases/latest),
   and [verify it](#verifying-a-download).
2. In Claude Desktop, open **Settings → Extensions**.
3. Drag the file onto that pane.
4. Set **OPC UA endpoint** to your server's URL, e.g. `opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840`.
5. For anything other than a simulator, fill in the security fields below it —
   policy (`Basic256Sha256` unless your server is older), client certificate and
   key, username and password. Left blank, the connection is unencrypted and
   anonymous.

To upgrade, install a newer bundle over the old one. To remove it, use the same
Extensions pane — nothing is left behind elsewhere on the machine.

## 2. Single-file executable — no runtime at all

One binary, no Node, no Python, no `npm install`, no network access required
after the download. This is the route for a plant machine that has neither
runtime and no way to get one.

Download the file matching your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/releases/latest):

```
opcua-mcp-server-node-<platform>-<arch>       # ~110 MB
opcua-mcp-server-python-<platform>-<arch>     # ~30 MB
```

They are built from the two runtimes this repo maintains, from the same tag, and
behave the same — same tools, same responses, same version — apart from the
[declared runtime differences](compatibility.md#runtime-differences). The Python
one is a quarter of the size. The Node one runs on the maintained OPC UA client
library and offers the two AES security policies, which makes it the one to take
for a network you do not fully trust (see
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#cve-2022-25304--unbounded-chunk-reassembly-in-python-opcua)).
`<platform>` is `linux`, `darwin` (macOS) or `win32`, and `<arch>` is `x64` or
`arm64`.

Before running it, [verify the download](#verifying-a-download) — it is about to
be handed access to an industrial network.

Then make it executable and register it:

```bash
chmod +x opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64
./opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64 --install claude-desktop --url opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840
```

**Platform signatures.** Each release's notes state, per platform, whether its
executables carry a platform-native signature. The release workflow signs and
notarizes them when the project's Apple Developer ID and Windows code-signing
certificates are configured; until they are, the notes say so, and:

- **macOS** binaries are ad-hoc signed, not notarised, so Gatekeeper will refuse
  the first launch. Having verified the download, clear the quarantine flag once:

  ```bash
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine opcua-mcp-server-python-darwin-arm64
  ```

- **Windows** SmartScreen will warn for the same reason: having verified the
  download, choose *More info → Run anyway*.

A notarized macOS executable is not stapled — Apple staples tickets only to app
bundles, disk images and installer packages — so Gatekeeper checks it online at
first launch. On a machine that cannot reach Apple, rely on the checksum and
attestation checks below.

## 3. `--install` — let the server write the config

If you already have Node or Python, install the package and let it register
itself with **Claude Desktop** (`--install claude-desktop`) or **Codex**
(`--install codex`). This is worth preferring over editing a config file even if
you are comfortable with one:

- It writes **absolute paths** to the interpreter and the server. Claude Desktop
  is launched from the GUI and does not inherit your login shell's `PATH`, so a
  config that says `"command": "npx"` frequently works in a terminal and fails in
  the app — the single most common way MCP setup goes wrong, and `nvm` users hit
  it every time.
- It can express the whole security model — channel security, a pinned server
  certificate, user identity, tool profile, policy file, audit trail — and it
  checks the result with **the server's own startup parsers** before writing
  anything, so it cannot write a configuration the server would refuse.
- It **fails closed**. The default profile is `observe` (read-only), written into
  the config explicitly. A control profile has to be asked for with `--profile`,
  and a control profile for a remote endpoint whose certificate is not pinned is
  refused (see [Safety rules](#safety-rules)).

The easy path, for a real device — read-only, encrypted, and talking only to the
server whose certificate you pinned:

```bash
# Node
npm install -g opcua-mcp-server
# Python
uv tool install opcua-mcp-server        # or: pip install opcua-mcp-server

opcua-mcp-server --install claude-desktop --dry-run \
  --url opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840 \
  --security-policy Basic256Sha256 \
  --client-cert /etc/opcua/client.pem --client-key /etc/opcua/client_key.pem \
  --server-cert /etc/opcua/server.pem
```

`--dry-run` validates everything — that each file exists, that the combination
is one the server accepts — and prints the exact file it would write, a
**redacted** preview of the result and a security summary, without opening an
OPC UA connection or writing anything. Drop `--dry-run` to write it, then
restart the client. Generating those certificates is covered in
[certificates.md](certificates.md).

Against the bundled mock or a lab server on this machine,
`opcua-mcp-server --install claude-desktop` alone is enough.

### Letting the assistant operate equipment

Control tools (writes, method calls, alarm actions) need an explicit profile, an
allowlist, and — for a remote endpoint — a pinned server certificate:

```bash
opcua-mcp-server --install claude-desktop \
  --url opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840 \
  --security-policy Basic256Sha256 \
  --client-cert /etc/opcua/client.pem --client-key /etc/opcua/client_key.pem \
  --server-cert /etc/opcua/server.pem \
  --profile operator \
  --policy-file /etc/opcua/policy.json \
  --audit-file /var/log/opcua-mcp/audit.jsonl \
  --operator-id line-1
```

The policy file format, and why each of these matters, is in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#tool-profiles-and-control-policy).

### Flags

The setting flags are generated from
[`contract/config.json`](../contract/config.json), the one definition of every
`OPCUA_*` variable both servers read: each is the setting's key with dashes, and
`--help` lists them. Values are checked against the same schema — choices
(case-insensitive, canonicalised), numeric minimums, file paths (made absolute,
because the client starts the server from a directory nobody chose). A boolean
setting flag takes no value: its presence means `true`.

Two settings have no flag, and naming one is refused with a pointer here:
`OPCUA_PASSWORD` (see [Passwords](#passwords)) and `OPCUA_AUDIT_CHAIN_KEY_FILE`,
the HMAC key for `--audit-chain hmac-sha256`, which the schema keeps off command
lines as it does a secret. For an HMAC chain, install with `--audit-chain sha256`
(or none) and set both variables in the client config by hand, or use the
`.mcpb` bundle.

| Flag | Variable |
|---|---|
| `--server-url` (or `--url`) | `OPCUA_SERVER_URL`. Defaults to `$OPCUA_SERVER_URL`, else `opc.tcp://localhost:4840` |
| `--security-policy`, `--security-mode` | `OPCUA_SECURITY_POLICY`, `OPCUA_SECURITY_MODE` |
| `--client-cert`, `--client-key`, `--application-uri` | `OPCUA_CLIENT_CERT`, `OPCUA_CLIENT_KEY`, `OPCUA_APPLICATION_URI` |
| `--server-cert` | `OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`, which pins the server |
| `--username`, `--user-cert`, `--user-key` | `OPCUA_USERNAME`, `OPCUA_USER_CERT`, `OPCUA_USER_KEY` (for the password, see [Passwords](#passwords)) |
| `--profile` | `OPCUA_PROFILE`: `observe` (also `read-only`; the default), `operator`, `full` |
| `--policy-file`, `--allowed-tools`, `--allowed-write-nodes`, `--allowed-methods` | `OPCUA_POLICY_FILE`, `OPCUA_ALLOWED_TOOLS`, `OPCUA_ALLOWED_WRITE_NODES`, `OPCUA_ALLOWED_METHODS` |
| `--allow-acknowledge-alarms`, `--allow-insecure-control`, `--allow-unverified-server-control`, `--allow-out-of-range-writes` | the matching `OPCUA_ALLOW_*` overrides |
| `--audit-file`, `--audit-fsync`, `--audit-chain`, `--operator-id` | `OPCUA_AUDIT_FILE`, `OPCUA_AUDIT_FSYNC`, `OPCUA_AUDIT_CHAIN`, `OPCUA_OPERATOR_ID` |
| `--reconnect-initial-delay-ms`, `--reconnect-max-delay-ms`, `--reconnect-max-retry`, `--session-timeout-ms` | the reconnection settings |

And the installer's own:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--install <client>` | `claude-desktop` or `codex` |
| `--dry-run` | Validate, print the target file, a redacted preview and the security summary; write nothing |
| `--force` | Replace an existing `opcua` entry instead of refusing |
| `--store-password-in-config` | Copy `$OPCUA_PASSWORD` into the config file, in plain text. See [Passwords](#passwords) |
| `--allow-unverified-remote-control` | Write a control profile for a remote endpoint with no pinned certificate. Lab networks only |
| `--version`, `--help` | As expected |

The two runtimes' installers take the same flags and write the same
configuration for the same input: one shared table of cases,
[`tests/fixtures/install-cases.json`](../tests/fixtures/install-cases.json), holds
both to it. The one exception is a declared runtime difference. Each validates
with its own server's parser, so the Python installer refuses the two AES
security policies its runtime cannot negotiate.

### Safety rules

Refused outright (exit 1, nothing written):

- **A configuration the server would refuse at startup**: a mode without a
  policy, a policy without a client certificate, a pinned server certificate or
  a user certificate with no channel security, a username with no password, an
  unreadable policy file, an unknown tool name, a hash chain with no audit file.
  The installer runs the server's own parsers on what it is about to write.
- **A file that does not exist**, or an audit file in a directory that does not.
- **`--profile operator` or `full` for a remote endpoint without
  `--server-cert`**, unless `--allow-unverified-remote-control` is given. An
  encrypted channel to an unpinned server is encrypted to whoever answers at that
  address. "Remote" is anything but `localhost` (and `*.localhost`), `127.0.0.0/8`
and `::1`; an
  address the installer cannot parse counts as remote. The server's own lab
  override, `--allow-unverified-server-control`, does not stand in for this one:
  it is written into the config and opens control at runtime, while
  `--allow-unverified-remote-control` is only the acknowledgement that doing so
  against a remote host is intended.

Refused as usage errors (exit 2): an unknown flag or choice, a number below the
schema's minimum, a blank value, key material pasted into a path flag, and any
secret as a flag (`--password`), or a setting kept off the installer
(`--audit-chain-key-file`).

Written, with a `WARNING [code]` on stderr: a remote endpoint with no channel
security (`no-channel-security`) or with an unpinned server (`server-not-pinned`);
a control profile written for an unpinned remote endpoint under
`--allow-unverified-remote-control` (`unverified-remote-control`); a password on an unencrypted channel; a password stored in the file; the
`OPCUA_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTROL`, `OPCUA_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SERVER_CONTROL` or
`OPCUA_ALLOW_OUT_OF_RANGE_WRITES` overrides; the `full` profile; a control profile
with no audit file, or one the server would offer no control tool (the warning
gives the server's own reason: no allowlist, no security policy, or no pinned
certificate); and a policy file whose `profile` the explicit `observe` default
overrides.

### Passwords

A password is never accepted as a flag: anything on a command line is visible to
every local user and lands in shell history, so `--password` is refused and its
value is never echoed. Private keys are passed as file paths, and a key pasted
into a path flag is refused the same way. Nothing the installer prints (preview,
summary, warnings, errors) contains a secret: `OPCUA_PASSWORD` and the
private-key paths are shown as `<redacted>`, and so is every `env` and `headers`
value of the other MCP servers in the file.

How the password reaches the server depends on the client:

- **Codex** passes named variables through from its own environment, so
  `--install codex --username <name>` writes `env_vars = ["OPCUA_PASSWORD"]` and
  no password at all. Export `OPCUA_PASSWORD` in the environment Codex runs in.
- **Claude Desktop** has no way to hand a password to a server registered in its
  config file except writing it there. The recommended routes are the
  [`.mcpb` bundle](#1-mcp-bundle-mcpb--claude-desktop), which keeps the password
  in the operating system's keychain, or X.509 user login
  (`--user-cert`, `--user-key`), which needs no password. `--install
  claude-desktop --username <name>` on its own is therefore refused.
- To write it anyway, opt in explicitly. The password is read from the
  installer's environment, never from its arguments, and the file is written
  readable by its owner only:

  ```bash
  read -rs OPCUA_PASSWORD && export OPCUA_PASSWORD
  opcua-mcp-server --install claude-desktop --username mcp-operator \
    --store-password-in-config ...
  unset OPCUA_PASSWORD
  ```

### Where it writes

It merges into whatever is already in the file, leaving your other MCP servers
untouched, and copies the previous config to `<file>.bak-<timestamp>` before
writing. A config it cannot parse is an error rather than something to overwrite.
For Codex it replaces only its own `[mcp_servers.opcua]` tables, and refuses an
entry written as dotted keys or an inline table rather than guess at it.

| Client | OS | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Desktop | macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude Desktop | Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude Desktop | Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, else `~/.config/Claude/...` |
| Codex | all | `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, else `~/.codex/config.toml` |

## 4. Editing the config by hand

The form the [README](../README.md#connect-your-agent) documents, and the
right one for Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Windsurf, or anything scripted:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opcua": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "opcua-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "OPCUA_SERVER_URL": "opc.tcp://192.168.0.10:4840" }
    }
  }
}
```

If Claude Desktop reports the server failing to start, replace `"npx"` with the
absolute path to your `node` and give it the absolute path to the server — that
is exactly what `--install` does, and why.

## Which runtime am I installing?

Either. Both are first-class ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-two-first-class-runtimes.md)):
one shared contract, one test suite run against both, one release gate, one
version number — the same tools with the same arguments and the same responses.
So this is mostly a question of what the machine already has. Where the two do
differ by design, the difference is declared, and the full list is in
[compatibility.md](compatibility.md#runtime-differences) — along with the known
divergences that are bugs still being fixed.

| | Python | Node |
|---|---|---|
| Requires | Python 3.10+ | Node 22.13+ |
| Package | [PyPI `opcua-mcp-server`](https://pypi.org/project/opcua-mcp-server/) | [npm `opcua-mcp-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opcua-mcp-server) |
| Fetch on demand | `uvx opcua-mcp-server` | `npx -y opcua-mcp-server` |
| Install permanently | `uv tool install opcua-mcp-server` | `npm install -g opcua-mcp-server` |
| MCP framework | `mcp` (`MCPServer`) | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` |
| OPC UA library | `opcua` (FreeOpcUa) | `node-opcua-client` |
| Source | `packages/server-python/` | `packages/server-node/` |

Exact dependency versions live in the manifests
([`pyproject.toml`](../packages/server-python/pyproject.toml),
[`package.json`](../packages/server-node/package.json)) rather than being
restated here, where they would drift.

The declared differences most likely to matter when choosing. The Node runtime
implements two extra security policies (`Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep`,
`Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss`) that `python-opcua` does not, and it sniffs certificate
files by content where the Python runtime goes by extension — so a PEM key must be
named `*.pem` there; both are covered in [certificates.md](certificates.md). The
`.mcpb` bundle and the MCP Registry listing are Node only. And the Python
runtime's OPC UA library is unmaintained — this project patches it
(CVE-2022-25304) and is moving it to `asyncua`
([#144](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/144)).

## Verifying a download

Everything on a [release page](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/releases)
— bundle, executables, npm tarball, wheel, sdist, the SBOMs and
`runtime-compatibility.json` — can be checked
three ways, none of which needs any access to this repository beyond reading it:

| File | Proves | Check with |
|---|---|---|
| `SHA256SUMS` | the file is byte-for-byte what the release workflow built | `sha256sum`, `shasum`, PowerShell |
| `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json` | `SHA256SUMS` was signed by this repository's `release.yml`, for this tag (Sigstore keyless signature, logged in the public Rekor transparency log) | `cosign` |
| build-provenance attestation | the file was built by `release.yml` from a specific commit of `IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP` on a GitHub-hosted runner (SLSA provenance) | `gh` with any GitHub account |
| `<file>.cdx.json` and its attestation | what the file contains — every dependency with version and hash, the lockfile digest, the toolchain, and for an executable the embedded runtime | any CycloneDX tool; `gh` |

The release workflow runs every one of these checks against the files as GitHub
serves them before it makes the release public, so a release that is public has
passed them once already. Running them yourself proves nothing changed since.
(Releases cut before this was introduced, 0.5.1 and earlier, carry the files
only.)

Set the version once:

```bash
VERSION=0.6.0    # the release you downloaded
```

**1. Checksums.** Download the files you want plus the two manifest files (or use
the release page), then check them. `--ignore-missing` skips what you did not
download.

```bash
gh release download "v$VERSION" --repo IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP \
  --pattern 'opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64' --pattern 'SHA256SUMS*'

sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS         # Linux
shasum -a 256 --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS     # macOS
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$file = 'opcua-mcp-server-python-win32-x64.exe'
$expected = ((Select-String -Path SHA256SUMS -Pattern "  $([regex]::Escape($file))$").Line -split '\s+')[0]
if ((Get-FileHash $file -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -eq $expected) { 'OK' } else { 'MISMATCH - do not run it' }
```

**2. The manifest's signature.** With [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)
installed. The identity pins the signer to this repository's release workflow at
this exact tag; a signature from anywhere else fails.

```bash
cosign verify-blob SHA256SUMS \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v$VERSION" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

Steps 1 and 2 together are sufficient for any file listed in `SHA256SUMS`.

**3. Build provenance**, per file, without the manifest. Needs the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) logged in to any account (`gh auth login`):

```bash
gh attestation verify opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64 \
  --repo IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP \
  --signer-workflow IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/.github/workflows/release.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/v$VERSION"
```

For an air-gapped machine, fetch the attestation and Sigstore's trust root on a
connected one, carry them across with the file, and verify offline:

```bash
# connected machine
gh attestation download opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64 --repo IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP
gh attestation trusted-root > trusted_root.jsonl
# air-gapped machine (the .jsonl is named after the file's digest)
gh attestation verify opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64 --repo IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP \
  --bundle sha256:<digest>.jsonl --custom-trusted-root trusted_root.jsonl
```

**4. What is inside it.** Each artifact's SBOM is attested against the artifact's
digest, so the SBOM you read is provably the one for the file you have:

```bash
gh attestation verify opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64 \
  --repo IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom

jq -r '.components[] | "\(.name) \(.version)"' opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64.cdx.json
grype sbom:./opcua-mcp-server-python-linux-x64.cdx.json    # or any CycloneDX-aware scanner
```

The SBOMs are CycloneDX 1.5, generated from the lockfiles (`package-lock.json`,
`uv.lock`), so each lists every platform's dependencies — `pywin32` appears in the
Linux one. An executable's SBOM adds the runtime it embeds (Node, or CPython and
the PyInstaller bootloader). Build inputs are under `metadata.properties`:
lockfile digest, toolchain versions, and the source commit.

**5. Platform signatures**, when the release notes say they were applied:

```bash
# macOS: expect "Authority=Developer ID Application: …"
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 opcua-mcp-server-python-darwin-arm64
codesign -dvv opcua-mcp-server-python-darwin-arm64 2>&1 | grep Authority
```

```powershell
# Windows: expect Status "Valid"
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\opcua-mcp-server-python-win32-x64.exe | Format-List Status, SignerCertificate
```

### Packages from npm and PyPI

The registry copies are built by `publish.yml` from the same commit, not
downloaded from the release page, so verify them with the registries' own
mechanisms rather than `SHA256SUMS`:

```bash
# npm: registry signatures and the provenance attestation, for everything installed
npm install opcua-mcp-server
npm audit signatures

# PyPI: the PEP 740 attestation trusted publishing uploads with each file
uvx pypi-attestations verify pypi --repository https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP \
  "pypi:opcua_mcp_server-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl"
```

The same attestations are shown on the package pages (npm's *Provenance* panel;
PyPI's *Verified details*).

## Building the artifacts yourself

None of the downloads are required; each is one command from a checkout.

```bash
cd packages/server-node
npm ci
npm run build:mcpb            # -> dist/opcua-mcp-server-<version>.mcpb
npm run build:sea             # -> dist/opcua-mcp-server-node-<platform>-<arch>
```

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --group packaging
uv run --group packaging pyinstaller --noconfirm \
    --distpath packages/server-python/dist \
    --workpath packages/server-python/build-pyinstaller \
    packages/server-python/packaging/opcua-mcp-server.spec
```

Build with a Node that satisfies the server's own floor (>=22.13): each
executable embeds the interpreter it was built with, and then has to run the
server on it. That also means neither can be cross-compiled, so a release builds
one per operating system in
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

`tests/smoke/` builds all of these and drives them against a live OPC UA server;
see [testing.md](testing.md).

### Reproducibility

A build from source will not, in general, match the release's bytes, and
nothing above depends on it doing so: the release is verified by who built it
and from what (steps 1–4 of [Verifying a download](#verifying-a-download)), not
by rebuilding it. What is pinned is the commit (in the provenance), the
lockfiles (their digests are in every SBOM) and the toolchain versions (also in
the SBOM). What is not:

- **npm tarball, wheel, sdist.** `npm pack` and hatchling normalise timestamps
  and file order, and in our testing two builds of one commit with one
  toolchain are byte-identical. A different npm, TypeScript or hatchling
  version can still change the output, which is why the registry copies are
  verified by the registries' own attestations rather than `SHA256SUMS`.
- **`.mcpb` bundle.** esbuild output is deterministic for the same inputs and
  esbuild version, but the zip `mcpb pack` writes records file timestamps, so
  two builds of one commit differ.
- **Node single-file executable.** It is a copy of whichever Node 22 release
  the runner installed that day, with the application injected. The Node patch
  version moves between releases (the SBOM records which one), and a Developer
  ID or Authenticode signature embeds a timestamp, so two signed builds always
  differ.
- **PyInstaller executable.** The bootloader is precompiled per PyInstaller
  version, and the frozen archive embeds the interpreter build uv selected and
  compiled bytecode whose headers depend on the build environment; the same
  commit built twice, even on one runner image, is not byte-identical. The
  signature point above applies here too.

Bit-for-bit reproducible executables are out of scope for now (#145); the
guarantees above are authenticated origin, recorded inputs, and integrity a
consumer can check.
