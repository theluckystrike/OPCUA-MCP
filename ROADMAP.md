# Roadmap

What exists, what is being worked on next, and what is only an idea. This is an
order of work, not a schedule: nothing here carries a release date.

The manifests are at <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: version -->**0.5.1**<!-- END GENERATED: version -->.
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records what has actually shipped — including
entries under `[Unreleased]`, which are merged but not yet published to npm or
PyPI. The work in progress is the production-hardening epic
[#151](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/151). The
[v0.4.0](docs/ROADMAP-0.4.0.md) and [v0.2.0](docs/ROADMAP-0.2.0.md) engineering
plans are finished work, kept for context, as is
[#19](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/19), the feature epic
the list below grew out of.

## In the codebase today

- Python and Node implementations of one shared tool contract
  ([`contract/tools.json`](contract/tools.json)), kept in step by parity tests —
  every tool declares a result shape, each runtime's actual output is checked
  against it, and a differential suite then diffs the two runtimes against each
  other. Both runtimes are first-class
  ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-two-first-class-runtimes.md)).
- The tools listed in the [README](README.md#tools): reads, writes, browsing,
  path resolution, name search, method calls and address-space inventory, each
  with fully qualified records — a value arrives with its data type, OPC UA
  status, timestamps and, where the node publishes them, its engineering unit
  and range.
- History and server-side aggregates in one tool, and stored events in another.
  Both are always listed, and refused with `capability_not_supported` before
  anything is sent when the connected server lacks the capability.
- Data-change subscriptions with buffered records and optional deadbands, plus
  event collection and the Alarms & Conditions operator workflow: listing,
  acknowledging, confirming, commenting and shelving.
- Writes bounded by the value, not only the node: the `EURange` the equipment
  publishes, and per-node `min`, `max`, `enum` and `max_change` in the policy
  file.
- Configurable OPC UA channel security: policy, mode, client certificate and
  key, username or X.509 user identity, and a pinned server certificate, all
  validated at startup.
- An observe-only default tool profile, with `operator` node and method
  allowlists, a versioned JSON policy file, and control tools blocked unless the
  channel is secured and the server certificate is pinned (`OPCUA_SERVER_CERT`),
  or a lab override is explicit. Authorisation is derived
  from a `guard` each control tool declares in the contract, so a tool that
  declares none is denied rather than waved through, and allowlists can be
  pinned by namespace URI rather than by an index the server may renumber.
- Automatic reconnection with keep-alive and exponential backoff, re-creating
  data-change and event subscriptions on the new session, so neither server needs
  restarting when the OPC UA server does.
- A `get_server_status` tool reporting connection state, endpoint and security,
  the server's own `ServerStatus` and its namespace array — the one tool that
  answers while disconnected.
- Distribution as an npm package, a PyPI package, a Claude Desktop `.mcpb`
  bundle and single-file executables, each covered by artifact smoke tests.
- Three local mock OPC UA servers and an end-to-end suite that runs both
  runtimes against them in CI.

## Next

A critical review of 0.5.1 opened the production-hardening epic
[#151](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/151). Its server
identity before control, MCP transport start-up, bounded and machine-readable
partial results, audit durability, and release signing and provenance work has
merged (see `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)); the two runtimes'
remaining divergences are the open part. The epic lists the
issues and the order they depend on each other in.

Two items need no code:

| # | Work | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [MCP Registry listing](docs/mcp-registry.md) | The published package already carries `mcpName`; done when the entry resolves in the registry |
| 2 | Results from third-party OPC UA servers ([#147](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/147)) | Met for two lab-built servers (open62541 1.5.8, Eclipse Milo 1.1.7) in [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md); open for vendor equipment |

The second needs people with real equipment rather than changes to this
repository, and it is the one input this repository cannot generate for itself.
It is also what decides the one question the earlier reviews left open rather
than answered — whether this should serve a plant or a workstation (see below).

## Later, not started

Everything that was here at 0.3.0 — node search and browse-path resolution,
typed method arguments, full node attribute reads, X.509 user authentication —
shipped in 0.4.0, and the architecture review that opened #81–#90 is closed out
too. What is not in #151 is not queued.

## Considered and set aside

Closed rather than left open indefinitely, because an open issue with no
intended start date reads as a commitment. Each would be reopened if its
condition below is met.

| Work | Set aside because | Reopen when |
|---|---|---|
| Streamable-HTTP transport ([#14](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/14)) | The tool policy is enforced per process and has no notion of *who* is calling; an HTTP listener would make it a remote endpoint that can write to a PLC | [RFC 0001](docs/rfc/0001-remote-identity-isolation.md) is accepted and its security gates have implementation evidence (#148) |
| Multiple or file-configured endpoints ([#15](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/15)) | **Its condition has been met — see below.** | Superseded |
| Docker images ([#16](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/16)) | Four distribution channels already ship, and a container adds little for a stdio server that runs beside its client | A remote transport lands, or a deployment requires an image |

### Multiple endpoints: the condition was met, and the answer is still not yet

#15 was set aside on a stated condition — "Node-ID canonicalisation and URI-based
allowlists have landed" — because the objection was that a per-tool endpoint
argument would make `writable_nodes` mean different physical nodes per server, on
keys that are session-scoped. Both landed in 0.4.0 (`node_ids.py` and its Node
twin canonicalise spelling; `nsu=<uri>;i=…` entries resolve against the live
NamespaceArray on every connect). So the condition is met and the objection is
gone, which means the honest thing is to say what the *remaining* reason is
rather than leave a lapsed condition standing.

The remaining reason is that a second endpoint is not one argument, it is a
different product. Today `OPCUA_SERVER_URL` is process-global, every tool targets
it implicitly, stdio is the only transport, and each MCP client gets its own OPC
UA session — which on equipment where sessions are licensed is a cost per client
per endpoint. Serving a plant rather than a workstation needs, together:

- an endpoint registry, and an endpoint argument on every tool that names a node;
- policy scoped per endpoint, since `writable_nodes` for PLC A must not authorise
  anything on PLC B — which is the same missing notion of *who is asking* that
  set aside [#14](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/14);
- pooled sessions, so N clients do not mean N sessions per PLC;
- a transport that can serve more than one client.

That is one piece of work, not four, and #14 is half of it. The tool signatures
are the part that would have to change, and they were only just stabilised at
0.4.0 — so the sequencing that makes sense is to let
[#70](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/70) come back from real
equipment first: whether sessions are actually scarce, and whether anyone is
trying to run this for a line rather than for themselves, decides whether this is
worth the tool-surface break. Until then, one process per endpoint is not a
workaround, it is the design, and [the configuration guide](docs/configuration.md#one-process-one-endpoint) now says so
where someone would meet it.

**Reopen when** the [identity and isolation RFC](docs/rfc/0001-remote-identity-isolation.md)
is accepted and the implementation plan addresses its security gates (#148).
A multi-endpoint use case motivates that review; URI-based NodeIds alone do not
establish authenticated caller or credential isolation.

### The control audit trail, as it actually stands

This page used to say an audit trail had no plan yet. It ships, and has since
the policy layer landed — so here is what it does and does not do, which is more
useful than either claim.

Every `control` and `alarm-action` call writes one JSON line to **stderr**
(audit `schema_version` 2, wrapped here for reading; it is one line):

```json
{"event":"opcua_mcp_policy","schema_version":2,"timestamp":"2026-09-24T09:12:44.001Z",
 "call_id":"9f2c1ab4de77f031","attempt":1,"endpoint":"opc.tcp://plc:4840",
 "session":"3b91e0c4a77d2f10","session_generation":1,
 "operator_label":"line-a-hmi","operator":"line-a-hmi","mcp_principal":null,
 "process_identity":{"uid":501,"user":"opcua","pid":4242},
 "opcua_user_identity":{"type":"username","username":"line-a-operator","certificate_sha256":null},
 "profile":"operator","control":"secured","tool":"write_opcua_nodes","decision":"allowed",
 "node_ids":["ns=2;i=13"]}
```

Every field is described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#what-is-audited).

`decision` is one of `allowed`, `denied`, `completed` or `failed` — the outcome
as well as the verdict, because "permitted" and "happened" are different facts
and the gap between them is where a control call that reached the plant and then
failed lives. `call_id` is what joins a call's lines to each other, which they had
no way to be until [#87](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/87):
both runtimes serve calls concurrently, so overlapping writes interleave, and two
writes to the same node were not distinguishable by content. The targets come from the same `guard` declaration in
`contract/tools.json` that the policy authorises from, so the two cannot disagree
about which arguments matter. Reads are never audited; a trail that recorded
every read would bury the lines anyone is looking for. Neither credentials nor
written values appear, and a test asserts it.

**A retained record is opt-in.** stderr is what an MCP client shows the user and
what a log collector picks up, and it does not survive the process. Set
`OPCUA_AUDIT_FILE` and both runtimes also append every line to that file; a file
that cannot be opened stops the server rather than silently auditing to stderr
alone. The server never rotates the file itself; an external rotation is
detected and the file reopened. Since
[#146](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/146) a new file is
created `0600`, every record is fsync'd by default, and records are schema
version 2; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#the-durable-copy-opcua_audit_file).

Per-client approval semantics for control tools are the stated prerequisite for
[#14](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/14) and are tracked there.

## Helping

The most useful contribution is a result from a real server:

- Open a
  [compatibility report](https://github.com/IndustriAgents/OPCUA-MCP/issues/new?template=compatibility_report.md)
  for an OPC UA server that is not one of the mocks.
- Report where the mock walkthrough in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) leaves
  you stuck — onboarding bugs are bugs.
- Pick up an issue above; [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers layout,
  the tool contract, and how to add a tool to both servers at once.

Test only on equipment you are authorised to use, and keep writes, method calls
and alarm acknowledgements to a simulator or an isolated lab.
